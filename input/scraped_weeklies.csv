241040,Whakaari/White Island,11/11/2020,"Following a period of severe weather, on 11 November GeoNet reported some mainland observations of darker plumes and deposits on webcams; scientists conducted an overflight of Whakaari/White Island on 12 November to investigate. Aerial observations confirmed the presence of ash in the emissions, originating from the main steam vent at the back of the crater lake. An initial analysis indicated that the ash was from loose material around the vent being entrained into the gas-and-steam plumes. The Volcanic Alert Level was raised to 2 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Yellow reflecting greater unrest at the surface.

There was no notable change in the location and size of active vents, though rainwater had created a small shallow lake on the floor of the 1978/90 Crater. A small earthquake sequence and several episodes of slightly increased volcanic tremor were recorded the previous week; the seismic data and observations were unusual for the volcano and may be coincident with the ash in the plume. Gas output was higher than previous recent observations; carbon dioxide flux was 2,390 tonnes/day and sulfur dioxide flux was 618 tonnes/day. The Wellington VAAC noted that the gas, steam, and ash plumes rose to1.5-1.8 km (5,000-6,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted E and SE during 12-14 November, based on satellite data, reports from pilots, and GeoNet.

Small amounts of ash continued to be present in emissions seen during an overflight on 16 November. Laboratory data showed that the particulates were hydrothermal minerals and old volcanic material, with no fresh magmatic ash signatures. Carbon dioxide flux was 1,937 tonnes/day and sulfur dioxide flux was 710 tonnes/day, overall slightly lower than the previous measurement but still above background levels. Seismicity remained similar to the previous week, characterized by a sequence of small earthquakes, a larger than normal volcanic earthquake located close to the volcano, and ongoing low-level volcanic tremor. Re-suspended ash to 460 m (1,500 ft) a.s.l. that drifted E and NE was reported by the VAAC during 16-17 November."

211040,Stromboli,11/11/2020,"INGV reported that during 9-15 November activity at Stromboli was characterized by ongoing explosive activity from Area N (North Crater area) and in Area C-S (South-Central Crater area). Explosions from the N1 vent (Area N) ejected lapilli and bombs 80-250 m high, and produced ash emissions. Explosions at three N2 vents (Area N) ejected a mix of coarse and fine material at a rate of 6-10 events per hour. Explosions from vents in Area C-S also ejected fine material 150 m high at a rate of 1-2 events per hour.

A series of at least four explosions began at 2104 on 10 November with a major, six-minute-long explosion in the southern part of Area C-S. The event ejected pyroclastic material which fell radially and along the Sciara del Fuoco, and produced a vertical ash plume. Within 30 seconds a second pulse of activity from the central crater area ejected coarse material 300 m above the vent and then produced in tense lava fountaining. A small explosion from vent N2 concluded the series. During an overflight the next day, scientists identified thermal anomalies from lava at the bottom of the S1 and C craters (central part of crater terrace) and craters N1 and N2. A small lava flow from S1 was also visible, and a small hornito (h1) had formed just outside the crater. A second hornito (h2) had formed on the south flank of N2.

A series of major explosive and landslide events began at 1017 on 16 November and lasted for four minutes (based on the seismic signals). Explosions produced a dense ash cloud that rose 1 km, and within minutes caused ash and lapilli to fall in the town of Stromboli, about 2 km away on the NE coast of the island. A pyroclastic flow rapidly descended the Sciara del Fuoco to the NW coastline and expanded 200 m over the sea surface."

Strombolian activity originated from the E and central vents at SEC ejected lava onto the inner crater walls. Occasional ash emissions dispersed quickly near the summit. Activity intensified at 2020 on 13 December and lava fountains formed around 2300. Collapses of the SW part of the SEC cone spurred a series of pyroclastic flows. At 2315 a small pyroclastic flow traveled down the SSW flank. A second pyroclastic flow began at 2316 and traveled 2 km down the SSW flank and covered Monte Frumento Supino cone (SSW). At 2330 a third and minor pyroclastic flow traveled SSW. Around the same time as the generation of the first two pyroclastic flows, two fissures opened on the SW flank of the SEC and produced lava flows to the S and SW until about 2350. A period of lava fountaining was visible during 0050-0110 and 0210-0223 on 14 December.

During a field inspection on 14 December scientists confirmed the partial cone collapses and noted that the two lava flows (S and SW) were cooling.

358057,Cerro Hudson,12/16/2020,"SERNAGEOMIN reported that a notable change in seismicity at Cerro Hudson was characterized by an increase in the frequency and magnitude of volcano-tectonic (VT), hybrid (HB), and long-period (LP) signals during 1-15 December. Two swarms of VT earthquakes were recorded during 10-11 December, with the largest event, a local M 2.9, located 4.7 km ESE of the caldera’s center at a depth of 4.6 km. The largest of five HB signals was a local M 3.1, located 4 km ESE at a depth of 4.3 km. The earthquake locations suggested a relatively shallow source SE of the caldera. No deformation or surficial changes were observed. The Alert Level was raised to Yellow (second highest level on a four-color scale) on 22 December, based on the increased seismicity. ONEMI warned the communities of Aysén and Río Ibáñez, declaring a status of “Preventive Early Warning”, a level in between Green and Yellow."
332010,Kilauea,12/16/2020,"HVO reported that a new eruption at Kilauea began on 20 December, after almost a month of pre-eruptive activity that included a dike intrusion. An earthquake swarm on 30 November centered in the middle of the caldera was recorded followed by periods of increased seismicity in the upper East Rift Zone. Spikes in seismicity began on 2 December; at 1745 earthquakes intensified beneath the S part of the caldera; tiltmeters simultaneously recorded accelerated deformation, resulting in about 8 cm of caldera floor uplift. The data suggested that a small intrusion had a volume equivalent to the amount of lava erupted in just 1-2 hours from Fissure 8 during the 2018 eruption. On 3 December seismcity and deformation decreased to pre-intrusion levels.

On 17 December the number and duration of long-period seismic signals increased. An earthquake swarm and deformation were detected during the evening of 20 December. At about 2136 on 20 December an orange glow was evident in IR monitoring cameras, heralding a new eruption, and prompting HVO to raise the Volcano Alert Level to Warning and the Aviation Color Code to Red. Three fissures successively opened on the inner N, NW, and W walls of Halema`uma`u Crater; lava flows quickly boiled away the water lake, creating a vigorous steam plume, before the lava ponded at the bottom. Minor lava fountaining (25 m high) from the fissures was visible, with the tallest fountains reaching 50 m at the N fissure. Occasional blasts originated from the ponded lava. A M 4.4 earthquake beneath the S flank was recorded at 2236.

A gas plume was seen rising from Halema`uma`u Crater and drifting SW at 0215 on 21 December. Later that morning HVO lowered the Volcano Alert Level to Watch and the Aviation Color Code to Orange. The accumulating lava in the crater rose at a rate of several meters per hour. Sulfur dioxide plumes drifted NW. By the morning of 22 December, the surface of the lava lake was about 134 m above the bottom of the crater, or 487 m below the crater rim, and rising 1 m/hour. An estimated 10 million cubic meters of lava had been erupted so far. Sulfur dioxide emission rates remained high, at around 30,000 tonnes/day. Lava effusion stopped at the NW vent during 0730-0800, and, along with the W vent, was inundated by the lava lake sometime before noon."

The lake deepened from 181 m on 30 December to 191 m by 4 January, and the lake volume was an estimated 26 million cubic meters by 4 January. An island of cooler, solidified lava continued to float around on the lava lake’s surface, and by 4 January the island’s surface was 1-2 m above the surface of the lava lake. Over the week the island was joined by less than a dozen other small islands of cooled and solidified material that also moved around, though they mostly remained in the eastern part of the lake. The lava lake was also becoming perched as overflows of lava onto the narrow edge formed around the lake’s margins continued to build a levee; by 3 January the lake was perched about 1 m above the margin. Sulfur dioxide emissions fluctuated between 3,000 and 6,500 tonnes/day. Seismicity remained elevated but stable."
263250,Merapi,12/30/2021,"BPPTKG reported that during 25-31 December rock avalanches traveled as far as 1.5 km down Merapi’s NW flank in the Senowo drainage.

332010,Kilauea,1/6/2021,"HVO reported that lava effusion from vents on a cone on the inner NW wall of Kilauea’s Halema`uma`u Crater continued to feed a growing perched lava lake during 6-12 January. Lava flowed through a crusted channel into the lake during most of the week. A dome fountain of upwelled lava at the partially submerged inlet was 5 m tall early on 6 January. Dome fountaining had weakened early on 7 January, giving way to spattering at the top of the vent and the formation of a second cone. Dome fountaining was possibly visible again on 8 January. The lake was perched at least 1-2 m above its narrow edges, though late on 10 January the stagnant, eastern part of the lake had subsided and was 3-4 m shallower. Overall the lake had deepened just 2 m by 11 January, reaching 196 m, and the lake volume was estimated at more than 27 million cubic meters.

An island of cooler, solidified lava and the 11 smaller islands were relatively stationary in the E part of the lake. The dimensions of the largest island remained unchanged (250 m long and 135 m wide), though on 8 January the W end was 9 m above the lake’s surface and the high point was 23 m above the lake, suggesting that the island was rising.

360120,Pelee,1/6/2021,"L'Observatoire Volcanologique et Sismologique de Martinique (OVSM) reported that seismicity related to volcanism has typically remained low at Pelée since 1980, when monitoring instrumentation was first installed, with a few dozen earthquakes recorded per year. Swarms were recorded in 1980, 1985-1986, 2007, and 2014, though the latter two swarms were associated with tectonic events. Volcanic seismicity appeared in April 2019 centered 4-5 km below the summit and deeper (more than 10 km below sea level). In addition, tremor-type signals were recorded during 8-9 November 2020, possibly signifying a reactivation of the hydrothermal system. The seismic data recorded since April 2019 represented an increase above baseline levels recorded during 1 January 2015 to April 2019. As a result of this activity OVSM raised the Alert Level to Yellow (the second lowest level on a four-color scale) on 4 December 2020.

Seismicity remained above background levels during 18 December 2020-1 January 2021, with at least 14 volcano-tectonic earthquakes detected with magnitudes less than or equal to 1. Scientists did not observe fumarolic activity during an overflight on 29 December 2020. The number of high-frequency, volcano-tectonic earthquakes (M 1 or less) totaled 65 during 1-8 January. A significant number (249) of long-period earthquakes in a volcanic tremor-type signal were distributed over two periods, 0000-0200 on 3 January and between 2100 on 3 January and 0200 on 4 January. Two isolated, low-frequency, long-period signals were also recorded. The data suggested ongoing perturbation of the hydrothermal system."

During an overflight on 15 January scientists saw extensive vegetation damage on the E, S, and W inner crater walls; damage previously noted along the upper part of the SW crater rim had expanded downslope. The dome dimensions were estimated to be 340 m long, 160 m wide, and 90 m high.

Scientists visited the dome on 16 January and collected rock samples from the W part of the dome. They recorded temperatures around 590 degrees Celsius from the expanding dome front. Gas emissions were most notable from a small circular depression at the top of the dome. At night during 15-17 January residents to the W saw incandescence emanating from the crater, a phenomenon likely to be more frequent as the dome grows higher. Gas emissions were visible in the afternoon of 17 January rising from the top of the dome as well as from areas of contact between the new and old domes. An area of burnt vegetation extended from the dome along the W part of the crater floor.

241040,Whakaari/White Island,1/27/2021,"GeoNet reported that during the previous year temperatures of Whakaari/White Island’s steam and gas vents were regularly captured during helicopter overflights. These data showed a downward trend from temperatures of over 700 degrees Celsius in February 2020 to temperatures around 300 degrees Celsius recorded on 21 January. The recent gas-emission temperatures were similar to those measured in July 2018.

There was no evidence of eruptive activity observed during overflights in January nor signs of collapse in or near the active vents. A small amount of water had ponded on the 1978/90 Crater floor. Gas continued to be emitted from the active vents and from cooling lava that had erupted in December 2019, though the emission rates were the lowest recorded since that eruption. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 1 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Green."
211060,Etna,2/3/2021,"INGV reported that Strombolian activity from all four of Etna’s summit craters, the Southeast Crater (SEC), the Northeast Crater (NEC), Bocca Nuova (BN), and Voragine (VOR), was visible during 1-7 February; the last time that had occurred was during 1998-1999. The strongest and almost continuous Strombolian explosions at SEC originated from two vents in the E part of the top of the cone. Tephra accumulated near the top of the cone and rolled down the flanks. Minor ash emissions rapidly dispersed. Less-intense Strombolian activity occurred at the S vent. Intra-crater Strombolian activity at NEC sometimes produced nighttime crater incandescence. Strombolian activity at BN sometimes ejected coarse material beyond the crater rim, and rare ash emissions that had diffuse ash content. On 5 February scientists observed explosions from three vents at the bottom of the crater that had formed cinder cones. Nearby was another cone that occasionally produced dense emissions that rapidly dispersed. Strombolian activity at VOR ejected material that sometimes rose above the crater rim and generated diffuse ash emissions. On 5 February lava flowed into BN, overlapping flows from the previous week."

311060,Semisopochnoi,2/3/2021,"AVO reported that a 6 February satellite image of Semisopochnoi showed small ash deposits extending in a narrow strip less than 3 km N of North Cerberus Crater. The deposits were likely the result of a small explosions that occurred during the previous week. Steam emission obscured view of the summit crater. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were raised to Yellow/Advisory. A second ash deposit, similar to the first, was visible in a satellite image on 7 February. This deposit extended at least 3 km NE of North Cerberus Crater. Weather clouds obscured views of the S side of the volcano. The report noted that the ash plumes associated with the deposits had not been observed; they likely rose less than 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. and were short lived. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were raised to Orange/Watch."
282080,Aira,2/3/2021,"JMA reported that during 29 January-1 February incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was often visible nightly.

The western half of the lake dropped from 213 m on 3 February to 211 m on 4 February and stayed at that level during 5-6 February; the drop in lake level was likely the result of summit deflation that was detected by tiltmeters. The lake level had risen to 214 m by the morning of 7 February coincident with the onset of summit inflation. A small dome fountain was visible at the entry point of lava into the lake on 8 February. The stagnant E half of the lake, separated by a series of surface cracks, was about 5 m lowed than the W half."

360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,2/3/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) and National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) reported that the lava dome in Soufrière St. Vincent’s main crater continued to grow during 1-9 February. Gas data analysis conducted during a field visit showed that sulfur dioxide emissions were first detected on 1 February, suggesting that ground water was drying up and no longer interacting with the gas species. The dome had an estimated volume of 5.93 million cubic meters. Scientists observed damaged vegetation, likely caused by fire, on the NW part of the crater (just N of the dome). A report on 6 February stated that the dome continued to spread laterally N and S, with N as the dominant growth direction. Gas-and-steam continued to rise from the top of the dome as well as along the contact of the old and new domes. Scientists visited the Wallibou Hot Spring area on 7 February after a report of anomalously higher temperatures and gas odors; they collected water samples and took temperatures measurements for later analysis. Initial findings suggested the presence of hydrogen sulfide in that area and temperatures that had increased around 5-6 degrees; the lead scientist noted that based on their findings there was no increased risk associated with the hot springs. NEMO reminded the public to avoid the volcano and that descending into the crater remained extremely dangerous. The Alert Level remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
282030,Suwanosejima,2/3/2021,JMA reported that incandescence at Suwanosejima’s Ontake Crater was occasionally visible at night during 29 January-5 February.

211060,Etna,2/10/2021,"INGV reported that Strombolian activity from all four of Etna’s summit craters, the Southeast Crater (SEC), Northeast Crater (NEC), Bocca Nuova (BN), and Voragine (VOR), was visible during 8-14 February. The frequency and intensity of explosions at SEC were variable; almost continuous strong explosions originated from two vents in the E part of the top of the cone. Tephra accumulated near the top of the cone and rolled several tens of meters down the flanks. Minor ash emissions rapidly dispersed. Less-intense Strombolian activity occurred at the S vent (also called the saddle vent). Intra-crater Strombolian activity at NEC sometimes produced nighttime crater incandescence. The activity at BN sometimes ejected coarse material beyond the crater rim, and rare emissions that had diffuse ash content. The the VOR Strombolian explosions ejected material that sometimes rose above the crater rim and generated diffuse ash emissions.

During the morning of 15 February explosive activity at SEC gradually intensified. Activity originated from the E vents but sometimes intense explosions occurred at the saddle vent. A significant increase in tremor amplitude began at 1700. Tremor amplitude waned at 2100, the same time that explosive activity decreased. At 1700 on 16 February lava began advancing down the E flank of SEC. Part of the cone collapsed at 1705 and generated a pyroclastic flow that traveled 1.5 km along the W wall of the Valle de Bove. An ash plume rapidly dispersed to the S. Explosive activity at SEC increased and lava fountaining began at 1710. Ash clouds drifted S. Lava flows advanced into the Valle de Bove, reaching an elevation of 2,000 m by 1759 at the latest. Lapilli, 1 cm in diameter, was reported in Nicolosi (16 km S) and Mascalucia (19 km S), and ash and lapilli fell in Catania (29 km SSE). Ashfall was also reported in Syracuse, 60-80 km SSE. Another lava flow advanced N into the Valle del Leone. Lava fountains were about 500 m tall, possibly as tall as 600 m. Tremor amplitude began to decrease at 1750 and lava fountains ceased around 1800. Lava effusion from SEC gradually diminished; the flow in the Valle de Bove was a few kilometers long and smaller flows that had traveled N and S reached an elevation of 2,900. Strombolian activity persisted at SEC overnight during 16-17 February and ceased at 0715 on 17 February. Explosions at VOR were sporadic."

There were 8-12 explosions per hour, generating ash plumes that rose as high as 1.1 km above the crater rim that drifted 15-20 km W and SE. Ashfall was reported in areas downwind including Santa Sofía, Panimache, Morelia, and Yucales, and shockwaves were audible up to 15 km away. The number of explosions increased to 3-6 per hour during 11-12 February. Ash-and-gas plumes rose to 1.1 km and drifted W and SW, causing ashfall in Sangre de Cristo, Palo Verde, and Yepocapa. Shock waves were felt by nearby residents. Avalanches of material descended the flanks, reaching vegetated areas.

During 12-13 February incandescent material was ejected 200 m above the summit and shock waved vibrated local structures. A lava flow had traveled 1 km down the Ceniza drainage, spalling blocks from the flow front that reached vegetated areas. By 14 February the lava flow had lengthened to 1.5 km and a lava flow in the Seca drainage traveled 500 m. During 1020-1023 a series of pyroclastic flows traveled several hundred meters down the Ceniza. Ash plumes from explosions rose 850 m and drifted NE, E, and SE, and caused ashfall in Alotenango, El Porvenir, and Finca La Reunion, in the department of Sacatépequez. During 14-15 February explosions ejected incandescent material 100 m above the summit and rattled nearby structures. Ash plumes rose as high as 450 m and drifted short distances E. Lava flows remained active; they were 800 and 200 m long in the Ceniza and Seca drainages, respectively. Block avalanches from the lava-flow fronts reached vegetated areas.

The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4), with a general exclusion zone of 3 km and extensions to 5 km in the SE sector and 4 km in the NE sector."
360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,2/10/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) and National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) reported that the lava dome in Soufrière St. Vincent’s main crater continued to grow during 10-16 February. Gas-and-steam continued to rise from the top of the dome as well as along the contact of the old and new domes. The dome also grew taller and spread laterally to the NW and SE. By 12 February the it was 90 m tall, 618 m long, 232 m wide, and had an estimated volume of 6.83 million cubic meters. Four additional seismometers were installed, strengthening the seismic network. NEMO reminded the public to avoid the volcano and that descending into the crater remained extremely dangerous. The Alert Level remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
282030,Suwanosejima,2/10/2021,JMA reported that incandescence at Suwanosejima’s Ontake Crater was occasionally visible at night during 5-12 February. Intermittent eruptive events produced ash plumes that rose as high as 1.2 km above the crater rim and ejected bombs 500 m away from the crater. Ashfall was reported in Toshima village (4 km SSW). The Alert Level remained at 2 (on a 5-level scale).
273070,Taal,2/10/2021,"PHIVOLCS reported that geochemical data collected from Taal’s Main Crater lake indicated a continuous acidification of the water from pH 2.79 to 1.59 between January 2020 and February 2021. A maximum temperature of 77.1 degrees Celsius was unseasonably high, and carbon dioxide/hydrogen sulfide gas flux ratios were consistent with shallow magma degassing. Tilt data indicated minor deflation around Main Crater, though minor inflation was consistently recorded across the Taal region as indicated by analysis of GPS data, InSAR, and microgravity changes.

A total of 68 relatively weak tremor signals were detected during 13-15 February; 50 of those were recorded during 0500-1500 on 15 February. The events on 15 February ranged in duration from two to five minutes and occurred at depths less than 1 km. The depth and location of the earthquakes suggested increased hydrothermal activity beneath Taal Volcano Island. Increased seismic activity continued through 16 February; from 0800 on 15 February to 0800 on 16 February there were a total of 98 earthquakes. The Alert Level remained at 1 (on a scale of 0-5) and PHIVOLCS strongly recommended no entry onto the island, and the Main Crater and the Daang Kastila fissure (along the walking trail) was strictly prohibited."

Ash emissions associated with the earthquakes rose 160 m and drifted NW and 280 m and drifted NE, respectively. The Alert Level remained at Yellow, the second lowest level on a four-color scale. ONEMI maintained an Alert Level Yellow (the middle level on a three-color scale) for the municipalities of Villarrica, Pucón (16 km N), Curarrehue, and the commune of Panguipulli, and the exclusion zone for the public of 500 m around the crater."
211060,Etna,2/17/2021,"INGV reported that a series of paroxysmal events separated by relative calm periods at Etna began on 16 February and continued at least through 23 February. The first episode began late on 16 February, characterized by gradually increasing Strombolian activity at the E vents of the Southeast Crater (SEC). Overflows of lava from the crater at 1805 caused a partial collapse of the cone and a pyroclastic flow that traveled 1.5 km along the W wall of the Valle de Bove. Lava fountains afterwards rose 500-600 m high. An eruptive plume rose several kilometers and drifted S, causing ashfall in areas as far as Syracuse, 60-80 km SSE. Lava flows advanced into the Valle de Bove and the Valle del Leone, and produced explosions in areas where they interacted with snow cover. Activity ended around 1900.

After a 30-hour pause the second paroxysmal episode began at 2330 on 17 February with overflows of lava from the eastern SEC vents. Lava fountaining began just after 0100 the next morning. Lava flows traveled towards the Valle de Bove, NE, SE, and SW. The eruption plume drifted SE, causing ashfall in Zafferana Etnea and Acireale. The lava fountains reached maximum heights of 600-700 m then ceased around 0140.

After another pause lasting about 32 hours, lava overflowed the SEC at around 0855 on 19 February. A rapid increase in explosive activity followed and lava fountaining began during 0945-0950. At 0953 lava fountains emerged from the S, or saddle, vent. At this time there were “fan-shaped” lava fountains rising from 4-5 vents orientated E-W. The eruption plume rose 10 km (32,800 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SE, again causing ashfall in downwind municipalities. Lava flowed S and towards the Valle de Bove causing explosions where they interacted with snow. Explosive activity ceased at 1110. Lab analysis of lava samples collected during 16-19 February eruptions showed that the magma was the most primitive over the past 20 years, meaning that the composition had changed little from its formation at depth and that it ascended quickly.

Weak Strombolian activity was visible in the late afternoon of 20 February. At 2230 a small lava flow descended a deep notch at the E end of the SEC and traveled towards the Valle de Bove. By 2300 the Strombolian activity had shifted to pulsating lava fountaining. Beginning at 0100 on 21 February more western vents became active and the E vents jetted lava 600-800 m high. Activity intensified at 0128 with jets of lava that rose more than 1 km high and were sustained for about 10 minutes. An eruption plume again rose to 10 km (32,800 ft) a.s.l. Beginning at 0200 the lava fountain became smaller, and at 0220 explosive activity ceased. Lava flowed SW and into the Valle de Bove.

Periodic ash emissions rose from both the S and E vents later than evening. Lava overflowed the SE crater just after 2230 and advanced 1 km towards the Valle de Bove. Lava fountains and Strombolian explosions occurred at multiple vents. Activity intensified at 0128 on 21 February and lava fountains rose 800-1,000 m above the SEC. Lava flowed from the S vent and an eruption plume rose several kilometers, but activity rapidly ceased at 0220. Lava flows continued to advance in the Valle de Bove; the longest flows were 3.5-4 km from the crater, between elevations of 1,700 and 1,800 m. During 0430-0515 very intense explosions from multiple SEC vents ejected incandescent bombs that fell as far as the base of the cone.

Weak Strombolian explosions at the SEC crater were visible late on 22 February. The frequency and intensity of the explosions increased and by 2210 material was ejected onto the flanks. By 2305 jets of lava were 300 m high, and by 2327 lava fountains rose from a second vent. Lava overflowed the crater at 2328 and headed towards the Valle de Bove. Within the first hour on 23 February lava fountains rose more than 1.5 km high and a sub-Plinian eruption plume had risen several kilometers above the summit, making this episode the most powerful and intense compared to the previous four. Lava overflowed the S vent and descended SW. Lava fountaining suddenly decreased at 0115 on 23 February, though lava flows continued to be fed. Strombolian activity again intensified at 0450, accompanied by ash emissions. Two lava flows formed and traveled SW and SE, the latter was longest and reached 1,700-1,800 m elevation. The activity ended at 1000."
300260,Klyuchevskoy,2/17/2021,"KVERT reported that during 1100-1150 on 18 February a new vent opened on Klyuchevskoy’s lower NW flank, near Erman glacier at elevations of 2,500-2,700 m, based on satellite images. Snowfall in the area of Klyuchi during 18-19 February inhibited webcam views. Bright incandescence was visible in webcam images beginning at 0323 on 21 February, likely indicating an advancing lava flow. On 23 February the Kamchatka Volcanological Station team reported that lava was flowing from two vents and bombs were being ejected 50 m high. A lahar along the Krutenkaya River was visible in an area 7 km E of Klyuchi Village (30 km NNE). Bright incandescence over the two flank vents was identified in satellite and video images on 24 February. KVERT raised the Aviation Color Code to Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,2/17/2021,"IMO raised the Aviation Color Code for Krýsuvík to Yellow on 24 February based on recent increased seismicity.

357061,Laguna del Maule,2/17/2021,"SERNAGEOMIN reported that during 1-16 February the seismic network at Laguna del Maule recorded a total of 533 volcano-tectonic earthquakes. Two earthquake swarms were recorded during 15-16 February; the largest events were local magnitude 3.1, and were located 9.1 and 8.8 km SW of the lake at a depth of 1.9 km. The epicenters were near the area producing anomalous carbon dioxide emissions. Swarms were recorded in June and December 2020, and January and February 2021, with the largest events occurring during the most recent swarm.

The highest rate of inflation during the previous 30 days was 2.3 cm/month, recorded at a station closest to the center of deformation. The highest horizontal displacement was an estimated 1.4 cm/month from a station just SW of the center. InSAR data mostly showed agreement in the magnitude and distribution of the ground-based deformation data. Overall, the deformation rates were higher than maximum averages. On 22 February the Alert Level was raised to Yellow, the second lowest level on a four-color scale. ONEMI declared a Yellow Alert for San Clemente and recommended restricted access within a radius of 2 km from the center of elevated carbon dioxide emissions."
342110,Pacaya,2/17/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that seismicity at Pacaya increased around 0900 on 18 February. Incandescent material was ejected 200 m above Mackenney Crater and explosions produced gas-and-ash plumes that rose 450 m and drifted mostly NE and S. An active lava flow on the SSW flank was 1.1 km long and generated hot block avalanches from the flow front. A lava flow emerged on the SW flank on 19 February. During 19-20 February periods of increased activity lasted 3-5 hours; moderate-to-loud explosions were accompanied by rumbling and sounds resembling trains. Ballistics were ejected 300- 500 m from the crater and ash plumes rose as high as 450 m and drifted SW. Ashfall was reported in areas downwind including El Rodeo and El Patrocinio. A lava flow on the S flank was 800 m long and produced incandescent blocks from the flow front that descended 500 m.

Strombolian activity increased on the morning of 20 February but fluctuated throughout the day. Ash plumes, that were dense during periods of heightened activity, rose 450 m and drifted 10-25 km S, SW, and W. As it grew darker lava fountains were visible rising 300-400 m and ballistics were ejected as far as 500 m from the crater. The lava flow on the S flank had lengthened to 1.1 km. Strombolian explosions continued during 21-22 February, ejecting incandescent material 100-175 m high. Ash plumes rose 450-800 m above the summit and drifted possibly as far as 15 km NW, W, and SW, causing ashfall in areas downwind including San Francisco de Sales, El Cedro, El Rodeo, and El Patrocinio.

211060,Etna,3/3/2021,"INGV reported continuing episodes of lava fountaining at Etna’s Southeast Crater (SEC) on 2, 4, and 7 March. Weak Strombolian activity began at SEC at 1145 on 2 March, then intensified at 1234 and produced an ash plume. Lava fountaining began at 1324. Ash plumes rose to 9 km above the summit and drifted S, causing lapilli to fall in Nicolosi (16 km S), Aci San Antonio (18 km SE), Pedara (15 km SSE), and Catania (29 km SSE). Lava fountaining ceased at 1550, ending the eighth episode.

The ninth episode began at the SEC as weak Strombolian at 0120 on 4 March. Ash emissions were visible at 0200 but dispersed quickly. Strombolian activity at Voragine (VOR) was also visible with ejected material rising above the crater rim. Lava fountaining began at SEC at 0320, but by 0515 the activity had decreased. Lava flows that advanced towards the Valle de Bove were fed by spattering and a new vent that opened at the E base of the SEC. Strombolian activity at VOR changed to 300-m-tall lava fountaining at 0850. Ash plumes rose 11 km above the summit and caused lapilli to fall in Fiumefreddo (19 km ENE), Linguaglossa (17 km NE), and the area of Reggio Calabria.

The tenth episode began with Strombolian explosions at SEC and minor lava effusion at the new vent at the E base of SEC during the first hour on 7 March. Strombolian activity intensified at 0430; an eruption plume rose 5 km above the summit and drifted E. Lava overflowed the SEC onto the E flank and expanded into the Valle de Bove, reaching an elevation of 2,800 m by 0450. Strombolian activity again intensified beginning at 0520 and the lava flow advanced to 2,700 m elevation. Lava fountaining started at 0720 and ended at 0810. An eruption plume rose 10 km and drifted E.

Three lava flows were active and all had several branches; one traveled SSW, one traveled S, and one on the SE flank was 800-1,200 m long. During 6-8 March strong explosions ejected material as high as 500 m and produced dense ash plumes that rose up to 1 km. Lava flows continued to be active, sometimes producing block avalanches from the ends. On 8 March the S-flank flow was about 850 m long and continued to generated block avalanches. Strong explosions during 8-9 March ejected ballistics 300-500 m away from the crater. Dense ash plumes rose up to 1.5 km and drifted 30 km SW and S. The lava flow on the S flank was 900 m long and shed blocks from the end."
273083,Pinatubo,3/3/2021,"PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level for Pinatubo to 1 (on a scale of 0-5) on 4 March noting elevated seismicity with a total of 1,722 earthquakes recorded in two swarms since 20 January. The first swarm was recorded during 20-26 January and was comprised of local M 1-2.5 events that occurred along the Sacobia Lineament fault at depths of 15-28 km. A more persistent swarm followed; it was comprised of local M 0.5-2.8 events at depths of 10-35 km along another fault system, with a few shallower earthquakes occurring at both ends of the swarm. Carbon dioxide flux at Pinatubo Crater lake was 378 tonnes per day in February, within background ranges that topped 1,000 tonnes per day during the last decade. Minor temperature increases were recorded at fumarolic vents."
261080,Sinabung,3/3/2021,"PVMBG reported that the eruption at Sinabung continued during 3-9 March.

273070,Taal,3/3/2021,"PHIVOLCS raised the Alert Level for Taal to 2 (on a scale of 0-5) on 9 March based on increased activity recorded since 13 February. During 8-9 March the seismic network recorded a total of 28 volcanic tremor events, four low-frequency volcanic earthquakes, and one hybrid event at depths of less than 1.5 km. These events added to the totals of 866 volcanic tremor events and 141 low-frequency volcanic earthquakes recorded during 13 February-9 March. Overall, seismicity over the past month indicated increased magmatic and hydrothermal activity at shallow depths beneath Taal Volcano Island (TVI).

Over the past month minor deformation centered at a source beneath the SE part of TVI was evident in monitoring data, including integrated real-time ground tilt and continuous GPS, daily Electronic Distance Measurement (EDM) monitoring, and InSAR. The data also showed slow and steady inflation across the Taal region after the 2020 eruption. Geochemical data collected from Taal’s Main Crater lake indicated a continuous acidification of the water from pH 2.79 to 1.59 between January 2020 and mid-February 2021. Microgravity data was consistent with magma migration. PHIVOLCS strongly recommended no entry onto the island, and access to the Main Crater and Daang Kastila fissure (along the walking trail) was strictly prohibited."
312070,Veniaminof,3/3/2021,"AVO reported that elevated sulfur dioxide gas emissions at Veniaminof were first detected on 1 March and elevated surface temperatures were identified in satellite images sometime during 2-3 March. At 0513 on 4 March infrasound sensors recorded a small explosion, prompting AVO to raise the Volcano Alert Level to Watch and the Aviation Color Code to Orange. A low-level ash plume, to less than 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l., was visible in satellite and webcam images drifting SSE and minor ash deposits around the volcano were visible. Small emissions continued at least through 1048 that day. Sulfur dioxide emissions were visible in a webcam image on 5 March. Numerous small explosions were recorded during 6-7 March; some of them were heard and felt by residents in Perryville (35 km SE). Elevated surface temperatures were identified in satellite images, suggesting lava near or at the surface. During times of clear weather low-level gas-and-ash plumes were visible in satellite and webcam data and observed by pilots. The plumes mainly stayed below 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l., but at times went as high as 4.6 km (15,000 ft) a.s.l., and drifted 150 km NE.

On 7 March satellite images revealed that the emissions originated from a small cone in the summit caldera. Additionally, lava was likely effusing under the intra-caldera glacier in an area on the flank about 1 km E of the cone’s summit. This area produced incandescence and strongly elevated surface temperatures, as well as a small steam plume and meltwater. During 8-9 March satellite images showed a small, steam-rich plume drifting about 10 km NE at 4.6 km (15,000 ft) a.s.l."
282080,Aira,3/3/2021,"JMA reported that during 1-8 March incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was visible nightly. An explosion at 1810 on 1 March ejected bombs 600-900 m away from the crater; an eruption plume was not confirmed. That same day the sulfur dioxide emission rate was high, at 2,900 tons per day. An explosion on 5 March produced an eruption plume that rose 2.7 km above the summit and ejected bombs 800-1,100 m away. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a 5-level scale)."
268010,Dukono,3/3/2021,"Based on satellite and wind model data, the Darwin VAAC reported that during 7-9 March ash plumes from Dukono rose to 2.1-2.4 km (7,000-8,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted E, SE, and SW.

290380,Ebeko,3/3/2021,"Volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, observed explosions during 26-28 February and 1-2 March that sent ash plumes to 3.6 km (11,800 ft) a.s.l. and drifted in multiple directions. Ashfall was reported in Severo-Kurilsk on 26 February and 2 March. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
282060,Kikai,3/3/2021,"In response to an eruption at Satsuma Iwo-jima, a subaerial part of Kikai’s NW caldera rim, on 2 November 2019 JMA had raised the Alert Level to 2 (on a 5-level scale). Since then, surveillance cameras sometimes recorded minor incandescence reflected in emitted plumes. On 8 March JMA revised the Alert Level guidelines, keeping the level at 2, but reducing the exclusion zone around the crater from 1 km to 500 m."
332010,Kilauea,3/3/2021,"HVO reported that a vent on the inner NW wall of Kilauea’s Halema`uma`u Crater continued to supply the lava lake during 2-8 March through a submerged inlet. The sulfur dioxide emission rate was 1,000 tons/day during 2-3 March, and 800 tons/day on 7 March. The depth of the western part of the lake fluctuated around 219-220 m. The E half of the lake remained solidified and lower that the W half, with the crusted E half expanding towards the W. Rangefinder measurements and visual observations indicated that the eastern and western portions of the lake were rising at the same rate, suggesting that lava was accumulating under the crusted eastern portion.

In recent weeks a part of the cone, several meters NE of the main vent, occasionally fed short (less than 100 m) lava flows that entered the lake at the crusted margins. During 5-7 March flows from this vent poured lava into the lake at several shifting inlets, though lava also accumulated on the lake margin within 50 m of the vent. By midday on 7 March the flows had built a perched lava pond on the NW lake margin, but it abruptly collapsed just after 1300. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."

371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,3/17/2021,"IMO reported that a small eruption in the western part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, began at around 2045 on 19 March. The eruption was first visible in webcam images and confirmed by satellite data, and an orange glow in clouds on the horizon was seen from Reykjanesbaer and Grindavík (10 km SW). The Aviation Color Code was raised to Red. Reykjanesbraut, the main road from the capital region to Reykjanesbaer and the international airport at Keflavík, was closed.

A fissure, 500-700 m long, had opened on a slope in the Geldingadalur valley about 4.7 km N of the coast and just off the SE flank of Fagradalsfjall mountain. Small lava fountains rose as high as 100 m above the fissure, and by 1110 on 20 March, the lava had covered an area less than 1 square kilometer and was approximately 500 m across. The extrusion rate was an estimated 5 cubic meters per second. The Aviation Color Code was lowered to Orange because there was little to no ash production that would affect aircraft. Reykjanesbraut reopened, but Sudurstrandarvegur, the road along the S coastline, was closed between Grindavík and Thorlakshofn.

The eruption continued during 21-23 March with a consistent extrusion rate. About three cones had formed along the fissure; the tallest and widest was situated at the higher part of the fissure. Lava flows, mainly from the largest cone, fanned out to the NW, W, and SW, and also flowed S and fanned out to the E. Spatter was ejected above the cones. Video captured by visitors showed parts of the largest cone collapsing and rebuilding. The IMO periodically issued warnings about weather conditions that would cause high concentrations of volcanic gases to settle near the eruption site, causing hazardous conditions for visitors. IMO noted that through the night of 22-23 March night sulfur dioxide levels in Reykjavík had increased, though not to unsafe levels."

211060,Etna,3/24/2021,"INGV reported continuing episodes of lava fountaining at Etna’s Southeast Crater (SEC) during the week of 22-28 March, though weather conditions often prevented visual observations. Weak Strombolian activity at SEC began at 2005 on 23 March and turned into lava fountaining at 0330 on 24 March. A lava flow from the SEC was observed at 0335 which split in two, one branch traveling toward the Valle del Bove and the other to the SE; the lava was followed by a pyroclastic flow at 0336 that traveled toward the Valle del Bove. The lava fountain produced an ash cloud that rose to 6-7 km (20,000-23,000 ft) a.s.l. and extended SSE, resulting in ashfall on the S slope and in Catania (29 km SSE). Lava fountaining gradually decreased at 0700, and by 0945 it had stopped. The lava flows continued to advance. Activity in Northeast (NEC), Bocca Nuova (BN), and Voragine (VOR) was characterized by variable intra-crater Strombolian activity, accompanied by sporadic and weak ash emissions that quickly dispersed.

On 24 March explosions at SEC continued after the lava fountaining had stopped, producing an ash plume that rose 4.5 km (15,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SE. At night, ashfall was reported in Milia and Trecastagni (16 km SE). Explosions stopped by 1347 that day. By 25 March the two active lava flows had ceased and began to cool. Weak Strombolian activity at SEC on 30 March resumed around 2030; intra-crater explosions continued in the NEC, BN, and VOR, the latter of which produced discontinuous ash emissions that rapidly dispersed in the summit area."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,3/24/2021,"IMO reported that the small eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula continued during 24-30 March. Video and visitor photographs showed that continuous spattering and lava fountaining resulted in the formation of a second large cone adjacent to the main cone. Lava flows from both cones moved W and S within Geldingadalur valley. On 25 and 29 March the extrusion rate from the cone was an estimated 5.8 and 5.3 cubic meters per second, respectively, based on the latest Pléiades image acquisition (LMI).

A gas plume on 25 and 29 March rose to 1 km (3,300 ft) a.s.l; no ash or tephra was produced. Minor seismicity continued around the Fagradalsfjall area. Video data showed that on the morning of 28 March the N part of the largest cone along the fissure collapsed. Sulfur dioxide flux was 18-19 kg/s and drifted predominantly S. The IMO periodically issued warnings about weather conditions that would cause high concentrations of volcanic gases to settle near the eruption site, causing hazardous conditions for visitors. The Aviation Color Code remained Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions."

Highly elevated surface temperatures were visible in satellite images along with ash deposits that were primarily confined to the summit and upper flanks on 23 March. Low-level tremor was recorded in local seismic data. During 24 March explosions were recorded in local seismic data and in infrasound data sensors; frequent explosive booming (several per minute) was reported by residents in Perryville (35 km SE) and Chignik Lagoon (55 km NE). Cloud cover prevented visual confirmation during this period of increased seismicity. Fresh ash deposits extending 10 km SE in the summit caldera were observed in satellite data on 25 March. Satellite data also showed highly elevated surface temperatures at the summit and flank vent during clear weather days on 25, 28, and 29 March. Discrete, short-lived ash emissions were detected during the afternoon and evening of 27 March in images from the FAA webcam in Perryville. The intermittent events lasted several minutes and produced small ash clouds that rose less than 300 m (1,000 ft) above the vent and drifted SE, which may have resulted in trace ashfall in Perryville, though there was no confirmed evidence. The Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch and the Aviation Color Code remained at Orange."

282030,Suwanosejima,3/31/2021,"JMA reported that during 30-31 March large volcanic bombs were ejected at least 41 times from Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater as high as 800 m above the crater rim and to distances as far as 1 km. The Alert Level was raised to 3 (on a 5-level scale) at 0330 on 31 March and the public was warned to stay outside a 2 km radius of the crater. The increased activity prompted an overflight that same day where scientists confirmed several hundred high-temperature bomb deposits with a thermal camera within a 1 km radius. Explosions at 2205 on 30 March and 0257 on 31 March ejected bombs onto the S and SE flanks, respectively. Grayish-white emissions rose from the crater. After 1500 eruption plumes rose as high as 1.4 km above the crater rim. The number of explosions decreased; two per day were recorded during 1-2 April and one was recorded on 3 April. The Alert Level was lowered to 2 on 5 April and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater."
312070,Veniaminof,3/31/2021,"AVO reported that during 31 March-1 April clear satellite and web camera images of Veniaminof showed no signs of emissions.

211060,Etna,3/31/2021,"INGV reported continuing episodes of lava fountaining, intra-crater explosive activity, and discontinuous ash emissions at Etna’s Southeast Crater (SEC) during the week of 29 March-4 April, though weather conditions often prevented visual observations. Gas emissions rose from the other summit craters and occasional explosive activity was visible; puffs of ash sometimes rose from Voragine Crater during 31 March-2 April.

At 0707 on 31 March a loud explosion was followed by several ash puffs, marking the beginning of the 17th lava-fountaining episode since they began on 16 February. At around 1100 a thermal anomaly at the S base of SEC was visible during an overflight and in thermal camera images. Explosive activity increased by late afternoon and several lava flows effused from the S-base vent. The main part of the flow traveled towards the Valle del Bove with other smaller flows traveled S and SW. Two other vents at the S base had opened by evening and one ejected spatter a few tens of meters high. Periods of lava fountaining began through the night, and the main lava flow descended the W wall of the Valle del Bove. Strombolian activity intensified at 1950, with an eruption plume that rose to 1.2 km (4,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SSW. Lava fountaining began at around 0100 on 1 April. At 0218 lava overflowed the E rim of SEC and headed towards the Valle del Bove, running parallel to the flows from the S base.

Lava fountains continued to be visible during the morning of 1 April and intense Strombolian activity produced dense ash plumes that drifted S. By 0940 the eruption plume had risen to 9 km (29,500 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SSW. Lava fountaining ceased around 1000 and the eruption plume rose to 5.5 km (18,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted S. Ash fell in Milia, Nicolosi, and Catania and lapilli (1 cm in diameter) fell in Rifugio Sapienza. Lava effusion and flow advancement continued; lava from the S base of SEC spread out like a fan. A series of loud bangs were audible in the late morning and ash emissions continued until the afternoon. Lava overflowed the E rim of SEC at 1040, and a SSE flow entered the Valle del Bove at the SW wall. Explosive activity began to decline at 1320, and effusive activity waned overnight during 1-2 April."
311070,Gareloi,3/31/2021,"AVO reported that a loss of operation and communication with all seismic stations on Gareloi was likely due to snow cover. Both the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were changed to Unassigned, reflecting the lack of this data to detect unrest. The observatory noted that regional infrasound networks, lightning detection, and satellite images will be used to monitor and detected unrest."
332010,Kilauea,3/31/2021,"HVO reported that the W vent on the inner NW wall of Kilauea's Halema`uma`u Crater continued to supply the lava lake during 31 March-6 April. Lava flowed at a low rate from the main vent into the lake through crusted-over channels and submerged inlets. The total depth of the lake measured about 225 m and lava continued to circulate in the W part; the E half of the lake remained solidified and expanded toward the W. The sulfur dioxide emission rate was 1,200 tons/day on 1 April. HVO field crews observed weak spattering from two areas at the W vent during 1-2 April. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."
252010,Langila,3/31/2021,"Based on analyses of satellite imagery and wind model data, the Darwin VAAC reported that on 5 April an ash plume from Langila rose to 1.5 km (5,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SW."
264230,Lewotolok,3/31/2021,"PVMBG reported that the Strombolian eruption at Lewotolok continued during 30 March-6 April. Gray-and-white ash plumes rose as high as 700 m above the summit and drifted in multiple directions, though rainy weather conditions prevented visual observations during 2-3 and 5 April. Incandescent material was ejected 300-500 m above the summit and 500 m SE during 30-31 March; eruptive events were recorded by the seismic network on the other days but not visually confirmed. Rumbling was occasionally noted. According to news articles secondary lahars from Cyclone Seroja destroyed homes, and impacted as many as 300, in several villages to the SW; mud-and-debris flows and flooding severely impacted other parts of Indonesia and killed at least 70 people. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4) and the public was warned to stay 4 km away from the summit crater."
263250,Merapi,3/31/2021,"BPPTKG reported that the lava dome just below Merapi’s SW rim and the lava dome in the summit crater both continued to grow during 26 March-1 April. The SW rim lava-dome volume was an estimated 1,060,000 cubic meters on 1 April, with a growth rate of about 13,400 cubic meters per day, and continued to shed material down the flank. A total of 14 pyroclastic flows traveled a maximum of 1.8 km down the SW flank. Incandescent avalanches, recorded 158 times, traveled as far as 1.1 km down the SW flank. The summit lava dome had grown to 70 m tall and produced one incandescent avalanche. Minor ashfall was reported in Ngadirojo, Stabelan (4 km NW), Takeran, Tlogolele (5 km NW), Selo (3 km NNW), Pos Babadan (4 km NW), and Pasar Talun (12 km W).

311360,Shishaldin,3/31/2021,"AVO reinstated the Green Aviation Color Code and the Normal Volcano Alert Level for Shishaldin on 2 April, after several seismic stations again became operational following a months-long outage, thus improving the observatory’s monitoring capability."
261080,Sinabung,3/31/2021,"PVMBG reported that the eruption at Sinabung continued during 31 March-6 April. Weather conditions sometimes prevented visual observations of the volcano, though daily white fumarolic plumes were visible rising as high as 500 m above the summit. Avalanches were detected daily by the seismic network and observed traveling 500-1,500 m down the E and SE flanks. An eruptive event produced a gray ash plume that rose 500 m above them summit on 1 April. Pyroclastic flows went as far as 1.5 km down the E and SE flanks. Ash plumes rose 0.7-2 km during 2-5 April and mainly drifted E and SE. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4), with a general exclusion zone of 3 km and extensions to 5 km in the SE sector and 4 km in the NE sector."
360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,3/31/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) and National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) reported that the lava dome in Soufrière St. Vincent’s main crater continued to slowly grow during 31 March-6 April, expanding to the N and S. Gas-and-steam continued to rise from the top of the dome, as well as along the contact with the pre-existing 1979 dome. A swarm of volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes began at 0638 on 5 April. The number and frequency of the VTs increased until about 0830 and then stabilized. The rate declined at around 1400 and then significantly dropped at 1600, though small VT events continued to be detected through 1800. The events were located at depths of 6 km, slightly deeper than the swarm events recorded during 22-25 March, located at revised depths of 3-5 km. Several reports of felt events came from nearby communities, including Fancy and Chateaubelair. The largest event, a M 3.5, was recorded at 0920 and felt by local residents. The swarm was more intense than the previous one, with an average rate of about 50 earthquakes per hour compared with 1.5 per hour during 22-25 March. The Alert Level remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
311080,Tanaga,3/31/2021,"AVO reported a loss of operation and communication with all but two seismic stations on Tanaga, likely caused by snow cover. Both the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were changed to Unassigned, reflecting the inability to locate earthquakes to detect unrest.

300130,Karymsky,4/7/2021,"KVERT reported that the explosive eruption that began at Karymsky on 3 April continued through 11 April. A thermal anomaly was visible in satellite images during 2-6 April; weather conditions obscured views on other days. The 3 April explosion generated an ash plume that rose to 8.5 km (27,900 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 255 km NE. At 1745 on 11 April explosions produced ash plumes that rose to 4 km (13,100 ft) a.s.l. and drifted at least 65 km SE. The Aviation Color Code was raised to Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale) on 3 April."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,4/7/2021,"IMO reported that the fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 7-13 April. Lava from the third fissure flowed S into Geldingadalur and NE towards the Meradalir valley site. Flows from the three fissures connected into one flow field on 7 April. Another new fissure opened at around 0300 on 10 April, halfway between two existing fissures, and all four fissures were simultaneously active. Lava flowed towards Geldingadalur. Gas-rich emission plumes were visible in webcam images rising 1.1-1.3 km (3,600-4,300 ft) a.s.l. At least two new vents opened on 13 April based on webcam views. On 14 April IMO noted that lava was flowing from at least eight vents and unverified reports form the morning suggested two additional vents had opened. Sulfur dioxide gas flux was 29 kilograms per second, comparable to measurements collected during the previous few weeks.

IMO warned visitors that new fissures could open without adequate visible warning, especially in an area just S of Keilir, by Litla-Hrút, where seismicity was concentrated. They also warned of increased gas emissions hazards. The Aviation Color Code remained Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions."
342110,Pacaya,4/7/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that the eruption at Pacaya’s Mackenney Crater continued during 7-13 April. Explosions during 6-7 April produced ash plumes that rose 1 km above the summit and drifted 10 km W and SW. Ballistics were ejected 50-150 m above the summit. Explosions during 8-9 and 11-12 April produced ash plumes that rose as high as 1 km and drifted as far as 10 km NE, W, and SW.

The lava flow on the W and SW flanks was 3.7 km long and continued to be fed. Incandescent lava blocks were spalled from the flow front and vegetation was set on fire. The lava advanced W onto the La Breña farm and SW towards El Patrocinio and El Rodeo, near the Campo Alegre farm. On 12 April the flows burned La Breña coffee and avocado plantations. By 13 April the lava flows were 3.8 km long, and within 370 m of houses in El Patrocinio. Another flow front was 250 m E of El Rodeo, and obstructed the road that connects El Rodeo, El Caracol, and Los Pocitos."
233020,Piton de la Fournaise,4/7/2021,"OVPF reported that a seismic crisis at Piton de la Fournaise began at 1457 on 9 April and was accompanied by rapid deformation beneath the S flank. Seismicity indicated that a fissure opened at 1900 but could not be visually confirmed due to weather conditions. The Alert Level was raised to 2-2. During an overflight at 0840 on 10 April scientists observed a NNW-oriented fissure, 700 m S of Château Fort. Activity was focused at two vents, each producing lava fountains that were no higher than 30 m tall, though fountains also rose from other parts of the fissure. Slow-moving ‘a’a lava flowed SE and then curved E and advanced 1.6 km to 1,800 elevation. The N end of the fissure was no longer active. Two cones had formed over the main vents and were growing larger; by 11 April the more northern vent was the larger of the two. Fountains rose 30-60 m and the lava flow had advanced to 1,750 m elevation. By 1900 on 11 April the lava flow was 3.2 km long and had reached 1,690 m elevation. Lava fountaining continued at the two vents during 12-13 April, rising 20-60 m. The lava flow continued to advance; by 13 April the flow was about 3.6 km long and had reached 1,500-1,550 m elevation."
311060,Semisopochnoi,4/7/2021,"AVO reported that low-level ash emissions from Semisopochnoi were visible in satellite images on 12 April along with a steam plume drifting E beyond the island. Additionally, new ash deposits extending SE at least to the coastline were also visible. The event was recorded by the regional infrasound network. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Orange and Watch, respectively."
360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,4/7/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) and National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) reported that the effusive eruption at Soufrière St. Vincent (often simply referred to as “La Soufriere”) became explosive on 9 April after a period of increased seismicity, gas emission, and rapid dome growth. Earthquake swarms were recorded during 22-25 March and 5 April, signifying a change in the eruption pattern. Small earthquakes associated with dome growth were recorded on 7 April. Episodes of tremor indicating movement of magma and fluids close to the surface began at 0300 on 8 April and were again recorded at 0530, 0800, 1015, and 1300, slowly increasing in magnitude. Five long-period earthquakes and two brief swarms of VT events occurred in between the tremor episodes; ash venting occurred with the last episode. Sulfur dioxide emissions were identified in satellite data, and clouds of steam and gas were visible from the Belmont Observatory. Later that evening, incandescent material over the vent area was visible in webcam images, and views from the observatory indicated that the dome had grown significantly. The Alert Level was raised to Red at around 1830, and the Prime Minister issued an evacuation order for the Red Zone at the N part of the island, affecting 16,000-20,000 people.

An explosive eruption began at 0840 on 9 April when an ash plume rose to 8 km (27,900 ft) a.s.l. and drifted mainly ENE. Ash fell across the island, affecting communities including Chateaubelair and Petite Bordel, the observatory, Belmont and surrounding areas at the S end of the island, and forcing the closure of the Argyle International Airport (20 km S). NEMO stated that evacuations in the Orange and Red zones were impeded by significant ashfall and poor visibility, but by the evening most residents had been evacuated. A second period of vigorous ash venting began at 1445 and initially rose about 4 km (13,100 ft) a.s.l. Lightning was visible in the rising plume. Successive explosions and ash pulses fed the plume for hours and it rose to 16 km (52,000 ft) a.s.l. A third explosive series began at 1835. Ash venting occurred through the night, causing ashfall across St. Vincent and reaching Barbados, about 165 km E, significantly impacting residents on that island.

Periods of banded tremor began at 0330 on 10 April, lasting for periods of 20-30 minutes with 1-3-hour gaps. The tremor episodes were associated with explosive activity and stronger pulses of ash emissions to higher altitudes; ash plumes rose to 10.6-16 km (35,000-52,000 ft) a.s.l. throughout the day. The Washington VAAC stated that ash plumes during 9-10 April had drifted as far as 1,200 km ESE and about 3,000 km ENE. The Grantley Adams International Airport (GAIA) in Barbados also closed.

Ashfall continued to be widespread on 10 April; deposit thickness varied from less than 1 mm in Colonaire (~12.5 km SSE) to 10-15 mm in Rabacca (~7.4 km SSE). Scientists reported darkness at the observatory at 1617; video showed intense and continuous ashfall. Satellite data confirmed that explosions had excavated the 2020-2021 lava dome and parts of the 1979 dome, leaving a large crater.

Overnight during 10-11 April ash again fell island-wide, and also in the Grenadines (to the SSW), Barbados, and Saint Lucia (50 km NNE). Explosions early on 11 April were followed by widespread power and water outages on the island as reported by NEMO, and some houses had collapsed under the significant ashfall. Beginning around midday the periods between episodes of high-amplitude tremor lengthened from 1.5-4 hours to 5-8 hours. The VAAC reported that through the day ash plumes rose 12.2-16 km (40,000-52,000 ft) a.s.l. and continued to drift long distances to the ENE, E, and SE. A large explosion at 0415 on 12 April produced an ash plume that rose to 12.8 km (42,000 ft) a.s.l. Pyroclastic flows descended several valleys on the S and W flanks, reaching the coast at Morne Ronde (4.3 km W), Larikai (3.5 km WNW), and Trois Loupes Bay (3.5 km NW). Damage to vegetation was extensive along the W coast, stretching from Larikai Bay to Turner Bay. The pattern of seismicity again changed; high-amplitude tremor episodes ceased, but two low-amplitude and one high-amplitude episode were recorded during 0600-1700. Explosivity or notable ash venting coincided with the episodes; the spacing between explosive events increased.

A series of Vulcanian explosions began at 0630 on 13 April and lasted about 30 minutes. The VAAC stated that a dense ash plume rose to 11 km (35,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted E and SE, as well as N and NE. Pyroclastic flows traveled about 6 km WSW, reached the ocean at Wallibou Bay, and extended past the coastline over the sea. Scientists observed the western coastline later in the day and noted that pyroclastic flows had descended all valleys from Larikai (W) to Wallibou, a stretch about 5 km long. Lahar deposits were observed in the Sandy Bay area. The VAAC noted that at 1850 a new ash emission rose to 7.6 km (25,000 ft) a.s.l. and was associated with a thermal anomaly. UWI-SRC stated that a large explosion was recorded around 2300. Pyroclastic flows overnight were channeled to the E into the Rabacca River drainage. The Montserrat Volcano Observatory stated that a sulfur odor and minor ashfall from Soufrière St. Vincent was observed on their island (390 km NNW).

Daily satellite-based measurements of SO2 were notable beginning on 9 April. Though the initial explosion at 0840 showed relatively minor SO2 emissions, stronger, continuous ash and SO2 emissions began later on 9 April (at 1445) and continued into the next day, transitioning into discrete explosive events that continued a least through 14 April. Satellite data showed about 0.4 teragrams (Tg) of SO2 in the plume on 10 April, with some stratospheric injection. Simon Carn noted that this makes the La Soufriere eruption the largest tropical SO2 emission since the 2011 Nabro eruption, and the largest in the Caribbean since satellite measurements began in 1979. The SO2 plume initially fanned out to the NE, E, and SE across the Atlantic Ocean. Measurements during 11-13 April showed similar results of 0.4-0.6 Tg SO2 depending on altitude. The eastern edge of the gas plume reached about 4,700 km to the W coast of Africa by 12 April, and another 2,000 km inland to Mali and Niger on 13 April."
282030,Suwanosejima,4/7/2021,JMA reported that incandescence from Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater was visible at night during 5-9 April.

261080,Sinabung,4/7/2021,"PVMBG reported that the eruption at Sinabung continued during 6-13 April. Weather conditions sometimes prevented visual observations of the volcano, though white fumarolic plumes were visible almost daily rising as high as 700 m above the summit and drifting in multiple directions. An eruptive event on 7 April produced a gray ash plume that rose 1 km. Two eruptive events the next day generated ash plumes that rose as high as 700 m. Avalanches traveled as far as 1.5 km E and SE during 8-11 April. Ash plumes rose 500-1,000 m high on 10 April. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4), with a general exclusion zone of 3 km and extensions to 5 km in the SE sector and 4 km in the NE sector."
300130,Karymsky,4/14/2021,"KVERT reported that a thermal anomaly over Karymsky was visible in satellite images during 9-12 April; weather conditions obscured views during 13-16 April. An explosion at 1745 on 11 April produced ash plumes that rose to 4 km (13,100 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 112 km SSE. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,4/14/2021,"IMO reported that the fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 14-20 April. Lava flowed from about eight vents and the flow field continued to expand; on 14 April a new hiking trail (“A”) had been covered. Volcanic gas emissions were at dangerous levels during 14-15 April so the eruption site was closed to the public. At about 1500 on 17 April a new vent was confirmed to have opened. It was small and close to another crater, possibly the one that had opened on 13 April. Lava was not flowing from the northernmost crater (the first that had opened outside Geldingadalur) during 18-20 April.

The eruption had been ongoing for 30 days by 17 April. Based on a report from University of Iceland’s Institute of Earth Sciences, the average lava-flow rate during the first 17 days of the eruption was 4.5-5 cubic meters per second but had increased to 7 cubic meters per second over the previous 13 days. During 12-18 April the flow rate was closer to 8 cubic meters per second, a slight increase over the recent average. By 19 April the area of the flow field was 0.9 square kilometers and the total volume was over 14 million cubic meters.

IMO warned visitors that new fissures could open without adequate visible warning, especially in an area by Litla-Hrút, just S of Keilir, `where seismicity was concentrated. They also warned of increased gas emissions hazards. The Aviation Color Code remained Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions."
233020,Piton de la Fournaise,4/14/2021,"OVPF reported that the eruption at Piton de la Fournaise continued during 14-20 April. Lava fountaining was visible from both cones on most days, though sometimes inclement weather prevented visual observations of the eruption site. During an overflight on 16 April scientists observed that the most distal part of the lava flows had stopped advancing. The larger and more northern cone was 28 m high. The cone at a lower elevation, about 100 m away, had two vents. The smaller cone fed lava flows that traveled though tubes and emerged after 100 m, continuing to advance as many surficial breakout flows. The total length of the flow field was about 3.5 km and the maximum width was 750 m.

Sulfur dioxide emissions gradually increased between 400 and 859 tonnes per day during 9-12 April, peaked at 4,054 tonnes per day on 13 April, and then dropped to 2,100 tonnes per day on 14 April. OVPF estimated lava-flow rates based on the gas-emission rates, noting that weather conditions could affect the accuracy of the measurements. They estimated that the average flow rate in cubic meters per second was 20 during 9-10 April, an average of 24 with a maximum value of 59 on 13 April, 12.5 on 14 April, and 6.5-8.3 during 16-19 April. The Alert Level was raised to 2-2."
311060,Semisopochnoi,4/14/2021,"AVO reported that an eruption at Semisopochnoi continued during 14-20 April. Sulfur dioxide emissions were identified in satellite images during 13-14 April. An explosion was recorded by the regional infrasound network at 0417 on 14 April, though weather cloud cover as high as 4 km (13,000 ft) a.s.l. prevented satellite confirmation of an ash plume. Ash emissions began during the morning of 15 April and continued through the day, drifting more than 350 km SE at altitudes as high as 6 km (20,000 ft) a.s.l. They did not decrease in intensity, so at 1915 AVO raised the Aviation Color Code to Red and the Volcano Alert Level to Warning. Sustained ash emissions continued on 16 April, though the plume rose as high as 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. and winds pushed it N. Explosions were detected through the night and early in the morning. Minor ash deposits around the volcano were visible. Eruptive activity declined during 16-17 April; one clear satellite view suggested that activity had declined or ceased. At 1249 on 17 April AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code to Orange and the Volcano Alert Level to Watch. Several explosions were recorded during 17-19 April though weather clouds obscured views. Volcanic plumes were visible just above the weather cloud deck (situated at 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l.) and drifted S during 19-20 April. A few darker (possibly ash rich) plumes were visible in satellite data at 0700 and 1150 on 19 April and on 20 April."
360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,4/14/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) and National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) reported that the explosive eruption at Soufrière St. Vincent (often simply referred to as “La Soufriere”) continued during 14-20 April, though at a decreasing frequency. Explosions and pyroclastic flows were reported on 13 April, as well as lahars in the Sandy Bay area. During 14 April seismicity continued to be characterized by episodes of tremor, about 13-15 hours apart, separated by swarms of small, long-period (LP) earthquakes. An episode of tremor that began at 1135 was associated with increased explosive activity, though the emissions were gas rich and less energetic than previous events. Another episode of tremor began at 0230 on 15 April along with increased venting. Almost constant swarms of long-period and hybrid events were recorded through the day, punctuated by three brief episodes (less than 30 minutes) of low-level tremor. An episode of tremor began at 2100 and lasted 40 minutes, and was possibly associated with a minor increase in venting. For the first time sulfur dioxide emissions were successfully measured by ground-based instruments; scientists recorded 809 tons per day from a Coast Guard boat along the W coast.

Periods of tremor and near-constant swarms of LP and hybrid events were recorded on 16 April. An explosion at 0615 on 16 April generated an ash plume that rose about 8 km (26,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted W. A three-minute period of high-level tremor started at the same time and was flowed by over two hours of lower-level tremor. Sulfur dioxide emissions were again measured from the W coast, yielding a flux of 460 tons per day. The rate of LP and hybrid events dropped significantly at 2000. Sulfur dioxide plumes reached India.

Occasional satellite images of the summit showed a series of changes to the new crater, centered in the SW part of the summit crater. By 17 April an Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris scientist reported that the crater was about 900 m N to S, at least 750 m E to W, and about 100 m deep based on RADAR data. Several vents were either visible or inferred from points of emissions. Sulfur dioxide emissions were 232 and 391 tons per day on 17 and 18 April, respectively. A period of high tremor began at 1649 on 18 April. An explosion produced an ash plume that rose to 8 km (26,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted S and SW. This explosion occurred 52 hours after the last one and was the 30th since the explosive phase started. The period of tremor lasted until about 2100 and was followed by ongoing small LP and hybrid events. The rates of those events dropped again, at around 0100 on 19 April. One rockfall was detected by the seismic network at 0139, and two were noted the next day. At 0400 on 20 April a lahar was detected by the seismic network and lasted for 30 minutes; it possibly traveled down the SE flank.

During 15-19 April NEMO reported details about the people that have evacuated. The total number of displaced people was 12,775 by 19 April, with 6,208 people in 85 public shelters and 6,567 people (1,800 families) in private shelters. There were no casualties caused by the eruption."

360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,4/21/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) reported that eruptive activity at Soufrière St. Vincent (often simply referred to as “La Soufriere”) was relatively low during 21-27 April with the exception of one explosive period. During 20-21 April seismicity was characterized by a few rockfalls and volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes, and an increasing number of small long-period (LP) and hybrid earthquakes. Sulfur dioxide emissions were again measured from a boat near the W coast, revealing a flux of 350 tons per day. At around 1108 on 22 April explosions produced an ash plume that rose as high as 8 km (26,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted mainly N over the sea. High-level seismic tremor began at 1109 and lasted for about 20 minutes. Pyroclastic flows were generated early in the eruption and traveled down the W flank, reaching the sea within five minutes. Lahar signals were recorded later that day at about 2100. According to National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) the total number of displaced people was 13,154 by 21 April, with 6,208 people in 85 public shelters and 6,790 people (1,618 families) in private shelters. There were no casualties caused by the eruption. In a 22 April press release the Argyle International Airport announced that the ash cleanup was ongoing and that the Cargo Terminal was scheduled to open the next day.

Seismicity dropped to low levels after the explosive event and remained at low levels through 27 April; only a few LP, hybrid and VT earthquakes were recorded. On 23 April the sulfur dioxide flux was 992 tons per day, recorded again from the W coast. A diffuse steam plume rose from the crater on 24 April. Satellite data most recently from 24 April, and seismic data suggested likely cycles of crater dome growth and destruction. During an overflight on 26 April scientists observed white steam plumes rising from several locations on the crater floor, though visibility was poor. No lava dome was visible, but a possible spine-like protrusion was seen through the clouds. Seismic signals indicating lahars were again recorded. Lahars in the Red and Orange zones were recorded by the seismic network at 0900 and 1000 on 27 April, during and after rainfall. The volcano Alert Level remained at Red."

290380,Ebeko,4/28/2021,"Volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, observed explosions during 22-24 April that sent ash plumes to 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted NE and SW. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
332010,Kilauea,4/28/2021,"HVO reported that the W vent on the inner NW wall of Kilauea's Halema`uma`u Crater continued to supply the lava lake during 28 April-4 May through a submerged inlet. The depth of the lake was about 227 m and lava continued to circulate in the W part, though the active area continued to shrink. The E half of the lake remained solidified and comprised about 93 percent of the total area, based on thermal measurements acquired on 16 April. The sulfur dioxide emission rate was 250 and 475 tons/day on 30 April and 2 May, respectively, continuing a downward trend that began in mid-April; the recent rates suggested that the effusion rate had also decreased. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,4/28/2021,"IMO reported that the fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 28 April-4 May. According to a news source, activity at the S vent of the fifth cone, which had opened on 13 April with N and S vents, intensified at around 2030 on 26 April. Fountaining became more explosive and lava was jetted 40-50 m high. The lava-flow rate significantly increased; lava flowed S then E and descended a valley into Meradalir.

By 29 April activity had intensified at the fifth cone where lava ejections reached 250 m high, but had ceased at the others. By 1 May lava flows had traveled N in Meradalir and connected to the flows that had previously descended into the valley from a fissure that opened on 5 April. IMO noted that fountaining at the vent was steady until around 0000-0100 on 2 May when it became more pulsating. Resting periods of 1-2 minutes were punctuated by intense fountaining reaching 100-150 m high for periods of 8-12 minutes. Gas plumes with minor amounts of ash rose 800-900 m a.s.l. A news source noted that on 2 May lava fountains rose over 300 m, the highest to date, and were seen from Reykjavik. Ejecta set fire to vegetation on the hill to the S of the vent, causing a smoke plume. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions."

360150,Soufriere St. Vincent,4/28/2021,"University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre (UWI-SRC) reported that seismicity at Soufrière St. Vincent (often simply referred to as “La Soufriere”) remained low during 28 April-4 May, with a few long-period, hybrid, and volcano-tectonic earthquakes recorded daily. Multiple significant lahars were generated by rainfall during 28-29 April. Lahars likely descended all valleys in the Red and Orange zones, and some were hot and visibly steaming. Trees brought down by lahars were swept to the sea; floating logs created hazardous conditions for small boats along the coastline. UWI-SRC and the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO) both warned the public to stay away from drainages and areas prone to flooding, and noted that lahars have caused notable erosion and damage to drainages and parts of the coastline. Smaller lahars were recorded during the mornings of 30 April and 1 May. Multiple lahars were detected in likely all the volcano’s drainages for a period of about six hours on 3 May, with the most intense lahars occurring during 1100-1200. Sulfur dioxide emissions were measured from a boat near the W coast, yielding a flux of 1,036 tons per day. Photos showed people in Sandy Bay shoveling off ash from rooftops on 4 May. The volcano Alert Level remained at Red."

Low-level background tremor that had begun at 0905 on 8 April continued, along with 2-26 daily low-frequency events and 5-37 daily volcanic earthquakes during 28 April-2 May. One hybrid event was detected during 28-29 April. Diffuse steam plumes from fumarolic vents in Main Crater rose 5-10 m on most days. Average daily sulfur dioxide emission rates were in the 1,452-3,191 tonnes per day range. Upwelling of hot volcanic fluids in the crater lake was accompanied by steam plumes that were 300-600 m tall on 27 April, 30 April, and 4 May. The Alert Level for Taal remained at 2 (on a scale of 0-5). PHIVOLCS strongly recommended no entry onto the island, and access to the Main Crater and Daang Kastila fissure (along the walking trail) was strictly prohibited."
241040,Whakaari/White Island,4/28/2021,"GeoNet reported that a brief period of low-energy tremor and acoustic signals was recorded at Whakaari/White Island beginning at 2230 on 29 April. During an overflight on 30 April scientists did not observe new deposits near the active vent or thermal anomalies at the active vent area. Gas-emission rates had been relatively unchanged since March. The brief period of increased activity was likely caused by a series of low-energy subterranean explosions, similar to activity observed in mid-February and early-mid March. Seismic tremor remained at background levels. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 1 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Green."
273010,Bulusan,5/5/2021,"PHIVOLCS stated that unrest at Bulusan had increased, noting that 62 volcanic earthquakes were recorded during 7-10 May and 124 were recorded during 10-11 May. Inflation of the upper flanks first recorded on 6 March in tilt data was sustained. GPS data indicated short-term inflation starting in late February, though the long-term pattern since July 2019 showed deflation. The data suggested shallow hydrothermal processes. The Alert Level for Bulusan was raised to 1 on 11 May, reflecting abnormal conditions, and the public was reminded not to enter the 4-km-radius Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ)."
357070,Nevados de Chillan,5/5/2021,"SERNAGEOMIN noted that sulfur dioxide emissions and thermal anomalies at Nevados de Chillán’s Nicanor Crater had both increased in March, and inflation began on 27 March. During the second half of April the dome grew at a higher rate, with growth concentrated on the W part. The dome was 66 m high at the center. The L5 lava flow advanced and was about 940 m long, and 50 m thick near the flow front. The effusion rate increased on 28 April.

On 2 May pulsating high jets of lava from crater 5 prompted authorities to widen the restricted zone because; ash and lava could be deposited several hundred of meters away. Cycles of lava jetting and effusion periodically continued during 3-7 May, with lava steadily enlarging the flow field. By 4 May the area of the flow field had grown to 1.41 square kilometers, and the total volume erupted was 23 million cubic meters. Activity was quiet for a period of time during 8-9 May, though IMO noted that fountaining quickly resumed during the morning of 9 May. High jets of lava occurred every 10 minutes, sometimes with jets rising as high as 300 m. Tephra (a few centimeters in diameter) was deposited as far as 1 km from the vent and small amounts of tephra were reported in Gríndavík. Hot deposits have caused small vegetation fires within a few hundreds of meters around the eruption site. On 10 May gas plumes rose higher than 2 km a.s.l. The eruption area was closed due to local wildfires and unfavorable wind conditions. Very high fountains were visible in Reykjavik. On 11 May lava fountains again rose up to 300 m tall and were seen from the capital. The cone had grown to about 50 m high. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions."

311120,Great Sitkin,5/19/2021,"An increase in local earthquake activity at Great Sitkin during 24-25 May prompted AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code to Orange and the Volcano Alert Level to Watch on 25 May. An explosive eruption began later that day at 2104; the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were raised to Red/Warning, respectively. The explosions lasted for 1-2 minutes and produced an ash plume rising to 4.6 km (15,000 ft) a.s.l. that was observed by local mariners. Witnesses 42 km away heard “a very loud explosion.” After the explosive period seismicity decreased and satellite image images showed a detached plume drifting E. Around mid-morning on 26 May AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level to Orange/ Watch, respectively."
251020,Manam,5/19/2021,"The Darwin VAAC reported that during 20-21 May ash plumes from Manam rose to 2.1 km (7,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted NW."
223030,Nyiragongo,5/19/2021,"At around 1815 on 22 May seismicity at Nyiragongo spiked, around the same time observers reported at least two fissures opening on the lower S flanks, NW of Kibati (8 km SSE) and Rukoko (10 km S). Lava from the first fissure, originating near the Shaheru crater, flowed E over a major road (N2) and then S. The second fissure produced lava flows that traveled S, overtaking and setting fire to many houses and structures in communities north of Goma, just W of Monigi (12 km S). Video posted on social media showed lava fountaining from the fissures, a glowing red sky, and residents running through the streets. About 1,000 homes and buildings were destroyed and about 25,000 people were displaced. The lava cut off electricity and water supplies to some areas. The flow may have been as wide as 1 km and stopped 1.25 km from the Goma International Airport, in the SE part of the city, during 22-23 May. According to the Toulouse VAAC ash plumes may have initially rose to 13.7 km (45,000 ft) a.s.l., though subsequent estimates put the ash plumes mostly at 6.1-9.1 km (20,000-30,000 ft) a.s.l. during 22-23 May. Satellite images and local scientists indicated that the summit lava lake had drained before the flank fissures had opened, but began refilling afterward; collapses in the summit crater were the likely cause of the ash plumes.

Initial reports indicated that about 32 people had died: about 12 from lava and gas asphyxiation while crossing lava flows, and most of the rest from accidents while fleeing. Several people, including many children, remained missing, though families were continuing to be reunited.

Seismic data during 22-24 May showed events seemingly propagating from the summit area to the S into Lake Kivu. Several strong earthquakes shook buildings in Goma, causing some to collapse and injure people; a news article noted that tremor was felt about every 30 minutes beginning around noon on 23 May. Both airports in Goma closed for security reasons. A M 5.1 earthquake with a hypocenter beneath Lake Kivu was recorded at 1037 on 24 May. The VAAC noted that ashfall around the volcano and in surrounding towns was visible in satellite data. Cracks a few 10s of centimeters wide opened in different parts of the city on 25 May. The cracks stretched for several hundred meters from the northern city limit down to the lake, and were nearly 100 m long near the airport. Some cracks were hot and emitting gasses, and some were flaming. Ash plumes rose to 6.1 km (20,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted S; ground-based reports indicated ash in the atmosphere above Goma. Seismicity remained intense on 25 May with more than 130 earthquakes between M 2 and 5 recorded in a 24-hour period. News reports indicated hundreds of damaged buildings in neighboring Rwanda."

282030,Suwanosejima,5/19/2021,JMA reported that intermittent eruptive activity at Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater produced plumes that rose as high as 1.6 km above the crater rim during 14-21 May. Large volcanic bombs were ejected 300 m from the crater. Crater incandescence was visible overnight during 18-19 May. The Alert Level remained at 2 and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater.
273070,Taal,5/19/2021,"PHIVOLCS reported that unrest at Taal continued during 19-25 May. Low-level background tremor that had begun at 0905 on 8 April continued. During 19-21 May there were 2-30 daily low-frequency events, 10-169 daily volcanic earthquakes, and 8-139 periods of volcanic tremor with variable durations (1-37 minutes); no earthquakes were recorded during 22-25 May. Most of the earthquakes were very shallow (less than 5 km deep) beneath Taal Volcano Island (TVI) and the NE part of Taal Lake. Daily upwelling of hot volcanic fluids in the crater lake was accompanied by sometimes voluminous steam plumes that were as tall as 2 km. Sulfur dioxide emissions were 2,811-3,611 tonnes/day. Slow and steady inflation of the Taal region was recorded by multiple instruments after the January 2020 eruption. PHIVOLCS noted the continuing state of elevated unrest, reminding the public that the Alert Level for Taal remained at 2 (on a scale of 0-5). PHIVOLCS strongly recommended no entry onto the island, and access to the Main Crater, Daang Kastila fissure (along the walking trail), and boating on Taal Lake was strictly prohibited."
311120,Great Sitkin,5/26/2021,"On 27 May AVO reported that seismicity at Great Sitkin was low following a 25 May explosion, and satellite images showed minor steaming and slightly elevated surface temperatures.

Seismicity remained low through 1 June; moderately elevated surface temperatures were detected during 29-30 May."
262000,Krakatau,5/26/2021,"The Darwin VAAC reported that on 25 May a diffuse ash plume from Anak Krakatau was visible in satellite images drifting SW at an altitude of 1.8 km (6,000 ft) a.s.l."
223030,Nyiragongo,5/26/2021,"Satellite data and analysis indicated that the lava flows at Nyiragongo during 22-23 May were the result of a N-S trending dike that had intruded beneath the volcano and Goma, and likely extended beneath Lake Kivu. Though lava effusion ceased, intense seismicity continued afterwards and indicated the dike continued to be active, according to GeoRiskA. Ground cracking in the city and damage to buildings from earthquakes continued to be reported. On 27 May authorities mandated an evacuation of the at least 400,000 residents in higher risk areas (about 10 districts) according to news organizations. The total population of Goma is an estimated 670,000 people. Photos in news articles showed masses of people and cars jammed for kilometers on roads leading out of the city. During 28-29 May GeoRiskA reported that seismicity began to decrease and continued a downward trend at least through 1 June; both the seismic data and GPS data indicated that the dike was no longer propagating. A news article noted that residents had begun returning to their homes within a few days.

Humanitarian organizations noted that within five days after lava flow stopped nearly 700 children had been re-united with their families, and more than 200 were in foster care or other transitional facilities. More than 170 families continued to search for missing children. The eruption had destroyed 3,629 homes, 12 schools, and 3 health facilities. More than 20,000 people were displaced and 31 had died. Goma’s international airport remained closed, though one across the border in Rwanda was operating."
311060,Semisopochnoi,5/26/2021,"AVO reported that an eruption at Semisopochnoi continued during 25 May-1 June. Steaming from the N crater at Mount Cerberus was visible in satellite images on 25 May. Radar data acquired between 15 and 27 May showed no morphological changes to the active vent. Tremor began to be recorded after AVO field engineers restored the satellite uplink to the seismic stations on 26 May. Field crews on 29 May observed low-level ash plumes rising to 2.4-3 km (8,000-10,000 ft) a.s.l., and small ash clouds drifting SW were visible in satellite images at around 0810 and 0920. Diffuse ash emissions were visible in satellite imagery at 1110. Strongly elevated surface temperatures were also identified in satellite data. Increased seismic tremor and accompanying low-level ash emissions began at 0945 on 30 May, with ash plumes drifting S at an altitude of 1.5 km (5,000 ft) a.s.l. at least through 1250. Elevated surface temperatures were detected during 30-31 May, likely from hot material on the crater floor. Seismic data showed low-level continuous tremor and occasional small discrete events. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."
344040,Telica,5/26/2021,"INETER reported that a series of 16 small explosions at Telica began at 0508 on 22 May, and produced ash-and-gas emissions that rose 250 m above the crater. Tephra from the plumes fell back down into the crater."

The Alert Level remained at 2 (on a scale of 1-4), and the public was warned to remain outside of the 2-km exclusion zone."
290380,Ebeko,5/26/2021,"Volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, observed explosions during 21 and 23 May that sent ash plumes to 3.2 km (10,500 ft) a.s.l. and drifted NE and S. A thermal anomaly was identified in satellite images on 23 May. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
211060,Etna,5/26/2021,"INGV reported almost daily episodes of Strombolian activity at Etna’s Southeast Crater (SEC) during 24-30 May continued the recent pattern of Strombolian explosions followed by lava flows to the SW and occasional lava fountains. Ash plumes were visible most days, rising to a maximum of 7 km (23,000 ft) a.s.l. Tephra was collected in Milo (10 km E) on 26 May and in Petrulli (12 km SE) on 30 May.

The first episode of the week began at 2100 on 24 May, intensified during 2235-2345, and ended at 0010 on 25 May. Ash emissions at SEC began 1020 on 25 May, producing a plume that rose to 4 km (13,100 ft) a.s.l. and drifted ENE. Explosions were recorded at 1820 and within 30 minutes Strombolian activity was visible. Activity intensified during 2025-2100 and ended at 2215. Two eruptive episodes were recorded on 26 May, with peaks at 0350 and 1300. An eruptive episode on 27 May was not visually well-documented due to inclement weather, though it reportedly intensified at 1450. Tephra fell in Giarre (17 km ESE), Milo, and Fornazzo (10 km ESE). Another episode began around 0830 on 28 May, intensified around 0900, and then ended at 0930; ashfall was reported in Giarre. Two more eruptive events were recorded that day: during 1740-1815 and a more powerful one during 2115-2305. The last episode of the week began at 0545 on 30 May and lasted for two hours."
311070,Gareloi,5/26/2021,"On 27 May AVO changed the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level for Gareloi to Green and Normal, respectively, reflecting that communication with seismic stations had been re-established, allowing for the location of earthquakes and detection of unrest."

332010,Kilauea,5/26/2021,"On 27 May HVO reported that Kilauea was no longer erupting; the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were lowered to Yellow and Advisory, respectively. A decreasing rate of lava entering the lake caused the area of the active lava lake to shrink to two small ponds by 11 May. Lava had stopped flowing into the lake sometimes during 11-13 May, and it was completely crusted over by 20 May. Weak inflation and an increase in shallow volcano tectonic earthquakes at the summit that began on 11 May also suggested that magma was staying at depth."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,5/26/2021,"The fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 26 May-1 June. Cycles of lava fountaining followed by no activity persisted at the fifth vent. Lava fountains rose a few hundred meters above the vent and lava advanced in the Nátthaga and Geldingadalur valleys. Lava in Nátthaga continued to get closer to Highway 427 (Suðurstrandarvegur) to the S, and buried fiber optic communication cables. Seismic activity had been decreasing; during 21-28 May there were about 90 earthquakes, compared to the 200 events recorded the previous week. According to a news article, an estimated 31 hectares of vegetation had been scorched by fires set by lava and hot ejected material since early May. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities warned of increased gas emissions hazards."

The flow rate at the fifth vent, now the main lava source, was 12.4 cubic meters per second by 3 June, similar to the 11-13 cubic meters per second measured in May. Cycles of lava fountaining followed by no activity persisted at the fifth vent, though observers noted that the vent opening was getting smaller as the crater walls thickened. One observer described standing waves of lava 20 m high during a period of greater lava effusion. Lava advanced in the Nátthaga, Geldingadalur, and Merardalur valleys. The flows in Nátthaga continued to get closer to Highway 427 (Suðurstrandarvegur) to the S, covering an area with buried fiber optic communication cables. The leading edge of the flow ignited vegetation, causing small fires. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities warned of increased gas emissions hazards."
264230,Lewotolok,6/2/2021,PVMBG reported that white-and-gray plumes from Lewotolok rose as high as 500 m and drifted W and E almost daily during 1-8 June. Rumbling was heard every day.

Explosions partly destroyed the dome, generating ash plumes that rose as high as 1.4 km above the crater rim and pyroclastic flows that traveled as far as 1.1 km down the NE flank. Satellite images indicated that the L5 lava flow did not lengthen, remaining at 966 m, though the distal part of the flow widened. The L6 lava flow advanced at a rate of 1.16 m per hour to over 890 m long. The average temperature was 101 degrees Celsius with a maximum of 264 for L5 and an average of 121 degrees Celsius with a maximum of 293 for L6. A new lobate flow emerged just to the N of L6; measurements on 2 June indicated that the temperature of the flow was similar to that of L6. Data indicated that the lava dome in Nicanor Crater did not get larger. The average sulfur dioxide emission rate was 706 (± 216) tons/day, reaching a high value of 1,101 on 27 May. The number and intensity of thermal anomalies increased, and were notable on 20, 23, 25, 28, and 30 May, likely due to the active lava flows. The Alert Level remained at Yellow, the second lowest level on a four-color scale. ONEMI stated that Alert Level Yellow (the middle level on a three-color scale) remained in place for the communities of Pinto and Coihueco, noting that the public should stay at least 2 km away from the crater."

241040,Whakaari/White Island,6/2/2021,"According to GeoNet water filled in the vents of Whakaari/White Island’s 2019 Primary Crater based on 18 May webcam views. During an observation overflight on 27 May scientists confirmed the new lakelet and noted that several active steam and gas vents were under water. Thermal infrared measurements indicated that temperatures had cooled significantly. Gas emissions had not notably changed over the previous few months. A persistent gas-and-steam plume likely produced acid rain on the island. A period of low-energy volcanic tremor began at around 0400 on 1 June and lasted for two hours. Activity rapidly returned to low levels afterwards. Overall, seismicity was at background levels. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 1 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Green."

Lava fountaining from the fifth vent was periodically visible, and lava from the crater flowed in tubes as well as on the surface. Sections of the cone’s rim periodically collapsed, sending lava cascading down the flanks. A notable event on 10 June began with lava rising in the crater and vigorously splashing above the rim; an overflow began with several streams of lava that quickly merged into a wide, fast-moving “lava fall” that broke parts of the crater rim. On 13 June lava overflowed the southern area of Geldingadalur valley and flowed over hiking trail “A”, causing authorities to restrict access to the eruption site that day due to safety reasons. The narrow lava flow then turned E and entered the Nátthaga valley from the W wall and joined the larger advancing flow. Lava in Nátthaga continued to get closer to Highway 427 (Suðurstrandarvegur) to the S, and buried fiber optic communication cables. The leading edge of the flow ignited the vegetation, causing small fires. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities warned of increased gas emissions hazards."

No explosions were heard or visually observed, though the seismic network recorded weak explosion signals during 6-7 August."
284170,Pagan,8/4/2021,"Felt earthquakes and minor emissions from Pagan were observed on 29 July. No additional activity had been reported by 6 August; the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Yellow/Advisory, respectively. Seismic, infrasound, and web camera data from the volcano remained unavailable; no activity was observed in satellite images."
312030,Pavlof,8/4/2021,"Intermittent bursts of ash from the summit of Pavlof were visible in webcam views on 5 August, prompting AVO to raise the Volcano Alert Level and Aviation Color Code to Watch and Orange, respectively. The bursts formed diffuse plumes that rose just above the summit and drifted almost 10 km SE before dissipating. Minor daily ash emissions continued to be observed in webcam images during 5-9 August. The seismic network recorded elevated seismicity (tremor) and small explosions. Several small explosions were recorded during 8-9 August though weather clouds prevented satellite and webcam views."
311060,Semisopochnoi,8/4/2021,"AVO reported that an eruption at Semisopochnoi’s North Cerberus crater was ongoing during 4-10 August, characterized by daily explosions, ash plumes, and sulfur dioxide emissions identified in satellite images. Multiple energetic explosions were detected almost daily in seismic and infrasound data. An ash cloud rose to 1.5-3 km (5,000-10,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 33 km NE during 3-4 August. Ash emissions were also visible in webcam images and photographed by an observer S of the island. An ash cloud was generated at 2123 on 4 August and was visible in satellite data until 0250 on 5 August, drifting 180 km SE over Gareloi and southern Tanaga Island. A small ash cloud at 2040 on 6 August drifted 50 km beyond the N crater vent and quickly dissipated. Another small ash cloud at 2103 caused ashfall on the webcam located 5 km NE about 30 minutes later. Ash-and-steam emissions were visible in webcam images until 2333. A large infrasound signal was recorded at 0653 on 8 August, though weather conditions prevented visual confirmation of emissions. A possible small ash cloud was visible in a satellite image at 0700. At least three separate explosions were recorded at 1714 on 8 August and 0339 and 0417 on 9 August. A small ash cloud at 900 m (3,000 ft) a.s.l. was visible in satellite images on the morning of 9 August. There were 10 explosions recorded during 9-10 August; small ash-and-steam emissions were visible in the webcam and small low-level plumes were occasionally identified in satellite data. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."
282030,Suwanosejima,8/4/2021,JMA reported that 13 explosions at Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater produced eruption plumes that rose as high as 3.8 km above the crater rim during 30 July-6 August. Large volcanic bombs were ejected 500 m from the crater. Crater incandescence was visible nightly. The Alert Level remained at 2 and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater.

241040,Whakaari/White Island,8/4/2021,GeoNet maintained the Volcanic Alert Level at 2 and the Aviation Color Code at Yellow for Whakaari/White Island based on continuing unrest and data collected during a recent overflight. In a 9 August report GeoNet noted that temperatures in the vent area remained high at 520 degrees Celsius; crater incandescence continued to be visible in webcams images at night. Moderate levels of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions measured downwind of the volcano were similar to levels observed on 20 July. Low levels of ground deformation around the active vent and lake area were identified in satellite radar data. The interpretation of the data suggested a shallow magma intrusion beginning in June. Very steamy conditions obscured views of the vent area.
282080,Aira,8/4/2021,"JMA reported that incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was visible at night during 2-9 August. Very small eruptive events were recorded during 2-6 August. The sulfur dioxide emission rate was relatively elevated at 1,500 tons per day on 4 August. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a 5-level scale), and residents were warned to stay 2 km away from the crater."
283110,Asamayama,8/4/2021,"On 6 August JMA lowered the Alert Level for Asamayama to 1 (on a scale of 1-5), noting that the number of shallow volcanic earthquakes had been decreasing, sulfur dioxide gas emissions had been low, and deformation on the W flank had stabilized. JMA reminded the public to stay 500 m away from the crater."
357090,Copahue,8/4/2021,"SERNAGEOMIN and SEGEMAR reported increased activity at Copahue during 9-10 August, characterized as increased gas emissions, ash emissions, and crater incandescence. During the morning of 9 August gas-and-steam emissions increased and sulfur dioxide flux was as high as 7,200 tons per day. Crater incandescence was visible in nighttime webcam views and was intense during the early hours of 10 August. An ash plume rose 300 m above the crater rim and drifted N and NNW. Seismicity remained stable; data suggested no rising magma. The Alert Level remained at Green (the lowest level on a four-color scale)."
268010,Dukono,8/4/2021,"PVMBG reported that during 3-4 and 6 August white-and-gray ash plumes from Dukono rose 100-500 m above the summit and drifted E and W. Weather conditions prevented visual observations during 5 and 7-10 August. The Alert Level remained at 2 (on a scale of 1-4), and the public was warned to remain outside of the 2-km exclusion zone."
290380,Ebeko,8/4/2021,"According to volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, explosions during 29 July, 1 August, and 3-5 August produced ash plumes that rose as high as 2.5 km (8,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted S and SE. A thermal anomaly was identified in satellite images on 1 August. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
211060,Etna,8/4/2021,"INGV reported continuing activity at Etna’s summit craters during 2-8 August, mainly from the Northeast Crater (NEC) and the Southeast Crater (SEC). Gas emissions rose from Voragine Crater and from two active craters in Bocca Nuova. A series of discontinuous ash emissions from NEC began at 1350 on 4 August and lasted about two hours. An ash plume rose to 1.8 km (6,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted NE. Similar but less intense ash emissions were visible on 5 August. The reddish mostly fine-grained material emitted from NEC was erupted when no thermal anomalies were present in the crater, suggesting that they were the result of landslides rather than eruptive activity. Strombolian activity began at SEC at 2057 on 7 August and was characterized by isolated explosions and the ejection of incandescent material beyond the crater rim; activity ceased during the night. An explosion at 2056 on 8 August was followed by the resumption of Strombolian activity at 0030 on 9 August. Incandescent material was again ejected beyond the crater rim and an ash plume drifted SE."
342090,Fuego,8/4/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that 4-13 explosions per hour were recorded during 3-10 August at Fuego, generating ash plumes as high as 1.1 km above the crater rim and shock waves that often rattled buildings around the volcano. Ash plumes mostly drifted as far as 15 km W and SW, causing daily ashfall in several areas downwind, including Morelia (9 km SW), Panimaché (8 km SW), Santa Sofía (12 km SW), Yucales (12 km SW), El Porvenir (8 km ENE), Finca Palo Verde, Sangre de Cristo (8 km WSW), and San Pedro Yepocapa (8 km NW). Block avalanches descended the Ceniza (SSW), Seca (W), Trinidad (S), Taniluyá (SW), Las Lajas (SE), and Honda drainages, often reaching vegetated areas. Explosions ejected incandescent material 100-400 m above the summit during 4-6 and 9-10 August. At 1700 on 6 August a lahar descended the Las Lajas drainage, carrying fine material along with tree branches and blocks 1-2 m in diameter."
300130,Karymsky,8/4/2021,"KVERT reported that a thermal anomaly over Karymsky was identified in satellite images during 29 and 31 July, and 1, 2, and 4 August. Weather clouds prevented satellite observations on the days in between as well as during 5-6 August. Gas, steam, and ash plumes from explosions rose 2.5 km (8,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 75 km SE during 1 and 4-5 August. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
264230,Lewotolok,8/4/2021,"PVMBG reported that the Strombolian eruption at Lewotolok continued during 3-10 August.

The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4) and the public was warned to stay 3 km away from the summit crater."
263250,Merapi,8/4/2021,"BPPTKG reported that the lava dome just below Merapi’s SW rim and the lava dome in the summit crater both remained active during 30 July-5 August. The SW rim dome volume was an estimated 1.895 million cubic meters and about 3 m tall. A total of seven pyroclastic flows descended the SW flank as far as 2 km and as many as 84 lava avalanches traveled a maximum of 2 km SW. Multiple pyroclastic flows traveled 2-3 km down the SW flank on 8 August and ash plumes rose 1 km above the summit. According to a news article ashfall was reported in several local communities. Pyroclastic flows traveled up to 3 km down the SW flanks multiple times during 9-10 August. BNPB noted that a small fire on the SW flank, 2.5 km from the crater, was set by ejected incandescent material; the fire burned an area of only 30 square meters during 25-26 August. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4), and the public was warned to stay 5 km away from the summit."
341090,Popocatepetl,8/4/2021,"CENAPRED reported that each day during 4-10 August there were 30-92 steam-and-gas emissions from Popocatépetl. The plumes drifted mainly W and some contained ash. A minor explosion was recorded at 0652 on 4 August. At 2137 on 6 August a moderately-sized explosion produced a plume, thought the height and drift direction were obscured by weather conditions. Incandescent fragments ejected from the crater were seen falling on the flanks not far from the crater rim. Weather conditions again prevented views of an explosion at 0258 on 8 August. The Alert Level remained at Yellow, Phase Two (middle level on a three-color scale)."
263340,Raung,8/4/2021,"PVMBG reported that neither explosive nor effusive activity had been recorded at Raung since February, and emissions were not observed during 1 July-8 August. Seismicity had declined and deformation data indicated a trend of deflation. The Alert Level was lowered to 1 (on a scale of 1-4) on 9 August, and the public was warned to stay away from the crater."
342030,Santa Maria,8/4/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that during 4-10 August daily explosions at Santa María’s Santiaguito lava-dome complex generated ash plumes that rose as high as 1 km above the summit and drifted as far as 7 km SW and W. Incandescence from the complex was occasionally visible at night. Collapses of blocky lava from Caliente dome sent avalanches down the S, SW, and W flanks, often reaching the base, and caused minor ashfall mostly on the volcano’s flank. Ashfall was also reported in San Marcos (8 km SW), Loma Linda Palajunoj (6 km WSW), and surrounding farms during 3-4 and 8-9 August. Heavy rainfall on 7 August caused a lahar to descend the Tambor River, carrying branches, tree trunks, and blocks up to 3 m in diameter."
263300,Semeru,8/4/2021,"Semeru continued to erupt during 4-10 August. Inclement weather often prevented visual observations, though during 4-7 August avalanches of lava from the end of the flow in the summit crater were seen traveling 200 m SE down the Kobokan drainage.

311160,Atka,8/11/2021,"The number of small shallow earthquakes increased at Atka during 10-11 August, prompting AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code to Yellow and the Volcano Alert Level to Advisory. The earthquakes were located at a depth of 3-6 km and around 7 km SW of Korovin, though may be related to the several vents that are part of the Atka volcanic complex. Seismicity declined afterwards but remained above background levels through 16 August, and was near baseline levels by 17 August."
290260,Chirinkotan,8/11/2021,"KVERT reported that the eruption at Chirinkotan continued during 11-17 August. An explosion at 1315 on 14 August produced a 15 x 17 km ash plume that rose 3-3.5 km (10,000-11,500 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 13 km SSE. Ash plumes from an explosion at 0945 on 15 August rose 2.5-3 km (8,200-10,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 8 km S. KVERT and SVERT noted that another explosive event at 1010 on 16 August generated ash plumes that rose 3.5-5 km (11,500-16,400 ft) a.s.l. and drifted 23 km E. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
284130,Fukutoku-Oka-no-Ba,8/11/2021,"JMA reported that a large eruption at Fukutoku-Oka-no-Ba commenced around 0620 on 13 August based on satellite data. Ash plumes rose as high as 16 km (54,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted W. The eruption was also confirmed during an overflight later that day. Video showed Surtseyan explosions ejecting black material above the ocean’s surface, and ash plumes drifted W. Ash plumes identified in satellite images rose 12.2-16 km (40,000-54,000 ft) a.s.l. during 13-15 August; the height of the plume decreased afterwards though the eruption intermittently continued. The Japan Coast Guard observed a new horseshoe-shaped island that was about 1 km in diameter during an overflight on 15 August. They also observed and photographed a notable pumice raft swirling with the currents as far as 60 km NW. JMA noted that the volcano last erupted in 2010 and frequent episodes of discolored seawater had been observed since then."
311120,Great Sitkin,8/11/2021,"AVO reported that the lava dome at Great Sitkin continued to be active, growing in diameter from 250 m on 6 August, to 380 m three days later, and to 700 m by 16 August. Steam-and-gas plumes were periodically observed in webcam images, in satellite data, and by observers on the ground during 11-17 August. Elevated surface temperatures and small earthquakes detected daily were consistent with the growing dome. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Orange and Watch, respectively."
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,8/11/2021,"The fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 11-17 August. According to the Institute of Earth Sciences photographs of the flow field captured on 8 August suggested that the lava effusion rate averaged 9.3 cubic meters per second over the previous 12 days. The area of the flow field had grown to 4.4 square kilometers, and the total volume erupted was 119 million cubic meters. New ground cracks were observed in Gónhóll, a hill S of the main crater (the fifth vent) that was a former vantage point but is now surrounded by lava, though they had likely formed sometime in the previous two weeks and may not have been caused by rising magma. A new vent that opened on 9 August was not confirmed to be separate from the nearby main vent until about a week later. The new cone quickly grew from intense spattering and by 17 August was around the same height as the main crater. Spattering from the new vent was at times ejected higher than spatter from the main vent. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities also warned of gas emissions hazards."
284096,Nishinoshima,8/11/2021,JMA reported that ash plumes from Nishinoshima were visible in satellite images on 14 August rising about 1.9 km and drifting N. The Japan Coast Guard conducted an overflight the next day and did not observe eruptive activity or new deposits from the day before. The Tokyo VAAC noted that a period of continuous ash emissions was visible in satellite data on 15 August.

Gas-and-steam emissions continued to be observed from the center of the island on 16 August. The pumice raft that was first identified on 15 August had expanded to about 100 km to the WNW and was about 13 km wide. Brown discoloration was visible surrounding the new island, which had a variable shape but a consistent diameter of 1 km by 16 August.

A local fisherman in the Ogasawara Islands who was fishing in South Iwo Jima (5 km NNE) posted photos and videos on 17, 20, and 22 August that showed strong white gas-and-steam plumes rising above the volcano. On 20 August lightning was visible within the gas-and-steam plume. On 22 August the plume was observed during 0430-0630."
332010,Kilauea,8/18/2021,"HVO reported that a swarm of earthquakes beneath the S part of Kilauea that began at 1630 on 23 August continued into the early morning of 24 August. The earthquake swarm increased in intensity at 0130 and was accompanied by an increase in the rate of ground deformation to the W of the swarm, as recorded by the Sandhill tiltmeter. This possibly indicated that there was magma movement 1-2 km beneath the S part of the caldera. Over 140 earthquakes were recorded during 24 August, the largest of which was an Mw 3.3; a majority of them were less than Mw 1. Small earthquakes continued at a rate of at least 10 earthquakes per hour through 24 August. As a result, the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were raised to Orange and Watch, respectively."

284170,Pagan,9/1/2021,"Continuous gas-and-ash plumes from Pagan were observed in satellite images for most of 1 September, prompting the USGS to raise the Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Orange/Watch, respectively. The plumes drifted 150 km NW and SW at an altitude of 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. The emissions briefly paused at 2300 and then resumed; satellite images acquired the next morning, on 2 September, showed gas-and-ash plumes drifting 650 km. A plume of ash and sulfur dioxide was identified in satellite data, drifting 150 km W at an altitude of 1.2 km (4,000 ft) a.s.l. early on 3 September. Ash deposits in and around the crater and on downwind parts of the island were observed in 4 September images. During 4-6 September gas-and-ash plumes rose to 1.5 km (5,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted at least 400 km W. Sulfur dioxide emissions were observed in satellite data on 6 September; ash emissions paused sometimes during 6-7 September as activity declined. A robust steam plume possibly containing a minor amount of ash was visible in satellite data on 7 September drifting 24 km W at an altitude of 1.5 km (5,000 ft) a.s.l."
312030,Pavlof,9/1/2021,"AVO reported that seismicity at Pavlof was low, though elevated above background levels during 31 August-7 September. Inclement weather sometime prevented satellite and webcam views of the volcano. A sulfur dioxide plume was visible in satellite images on 2 September. The Volcano Alert Level and Aviation Color Code remained at Watch and Orange, respectively."
241040,Whakaari/White Island,9/1/2021,"GeoNet reported that beginning at 0630 on 2 September minor ash emissions from the active vent at Whakaari/White Island were visible in webcam images. The emissions were observed in satellite images drifting SW and reaching the Bay of Plenty coastline. GeoNet noted that short episodes of minor ash emissions had been recorded during the previous few weeks, though none were as sustained as the 2 September episode. Minor ash emissions were also recorded on 3 September, but then ceased. The webcam continued to record nighttime incandescence from the vent, at least through 6 September, suggesting that temperatures were likely 500-600°C. Steam-and-gas plumes were voluminous, and coupled with weather conditions, were easily visible from the coast. Deformation measurement showed a broad area of subsidence around the vent area, possibly from the release of pressurized gas at depth and the more voluminous plumes. Additionally, the ash emissions may have possibly been caused by wall fragments falling into the vent. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 2 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Yellow."
290380,Ebeko,9/1/2021,"According to volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, explosions during 28-29 August produced ash plumes that rose as high as 1.9 km (6,200 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SE and E. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
342090,Fuego,9/1/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that 7-15 explosions per hour were recorded during 31 August-7 September at Fuego, generating ash plumes as high as 1.1 km above the crater rim and shock waves that often rattled buildings around the volcano. Ash plumes mostly drifted as far as 15 km SW, W, NW, and N, causing daily ashfall in several areas downwind, including Morelia (9 km SW), Panimaché I and II (8 km SW), Santa Sofía (12 km SW), Yucales (12 km SW), El Porvenir (8 km ENE), Finca Palo Verde, Sangre de Cristo (8 km WSW), and San Pedro Yepocapa (8 km NW). Block avalanches descended the Ceniza (SSW), Seca (W), Trinidad (S), Taniluyá (SW), Las Lajas (SE), and Honda drainages, often reaching vegetated areas. Explosions ejected incandescent material 100-350 m above the summit on most days. On 1 September lahars descended the SE, S, and SW flanks (the Las Lajas, El Jute, and Seca drainages), carrying fine material along with tree branches and blocks 2 m in diameter. Lahars descended the El Jute, Las Lajas, and Ceniza drainages during 6-7 September."
311120,Great Sitkin,9/1/2021,"AVO reported that elevated surface temperatures at Great Sitkin and daily small earthquakes were detected during 31 August-7 September, consistent with the growing lava dome. Gas plumes were observed almost daily in satellite data. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Orange and Watch, respectively."
373010,Grimsvotn,9/1/2021,"On 1 September the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) stated that the water level of the Skaftá river at Sveinstindur (the closest gauging station at 28 km downstream from the ice margin) rose, suggesting the beginning of a Skaftárhlaup or glacial outburst flood (also called a jökulhlaup), that originated from Grímsvötn's Western Skaftá caldera. A sulfur odor was also noted in the vicinity of Skaftá and Hverfisfljót. IMO warned that hydrogen sulfide released from the floodwater as it drained from the caldera lake was particularly potent at the river outlet from the ice margin, where concentrations may reach toxic levels. The flow rate in the Skaftá peaked at 520 cubic meters per second downstream near the bridge at Eldvatn on 2 September and then declined to 412 cubic meters per second in the afternoon of 3 September. As a result, the ice shelf began to subside around 2300 on 4 September, dropping 1 m by 1145 the next morning, based on GPS data. On 6 September the discharge rate increased rapidly and peaked at 610 cubic meters per second at 1400, then declined later that day. Data suggested that the peak discharge rate on 6 September was due to a second release of water from the eastern part of the caldera lake. On 7 September the flow rate had increased to 520 cubic meters per second. Based on an overflight IMO concluded that the glacial flooding from both the E and W parts of the lake was smaller in volume and flow rates compared to a similar event in 2018."
300130,Karymsky,9/1/2021,"KVERT reported that ash plumes from Karymsky were visible in satellite images drifting 50 km NE and E during 26-27 August, and a thermal anomaly over the volcano was visible every day during 26 August -2 September except for on 29 August.

Steam-and-gas emissions were seen rising from the crater during 2-7 September. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities also warned of gas emission hazards."
264230,Lewotolok,9/1/2021,"PVMBG reported that the eruption at Lewotolok continued during 31 August-7 September. White and gray plumes rose as high as 600 m above the summit and drifted W and NW. Rumbling and banging were heard on most days. Incandescent material was ejected 300 m on 1 September, as far as 1 km SE during 4-5 September, and 200 m during 6-7 September. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4) and the public was warned to stay 3 km away from the summit crater."
263250,Merapi,9/1/2021,"BPPTKG reported that both of Merapi’s two lava domes, situated just below the SW rim and in the summit crater, continued to grow during 27 August-2 September. The SW dome grew 2 m taller and had an estimated volume of 1.44 million cubic meters and the summit lava dome grew 1 m taller and had an estimated volume of 2.84 million cubic meters. A total of six pyroclastic flows descended the SW flank as far as 2.5 km; as many as 80 lava avalanches traveled a maximum of 2 km SW. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4), and the public was warned to stay 3-5 km away from the summit based on location."
341090,Popocatepetl,9/1/2021,"CENAPRED reported that each day during 31 August-7 September there were 66-102 steam-and-gas emissions from Popocatépetl. Cloudy weather often prevented views of the volcano. Crater incandescence was visible during the morning of 1 September and explosions were recorded at 2135, 2254, and 2345 later that same day. The Washington VAAC noted that ash plumes rose to 5.8-6.1 km (19,000-20,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted NW and W during 5-6 September based on satellite and webcam views. Explosions were recorded by CENAPRED at 1642 on 5 September and 0820 on 6 September. Emissions had a low ash content during 6-7 September; explosions occurred at 0212 and 0414 on 7 September.

The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale).
282030,Suwanosejima,9/1/2021,JMA reported that three explosions at Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater produced eruption plumes that rose as high as 4.8 km above the crater rim during 27 August-3 September. Large volcanic bombs were ejected 700 m from the crater. Crater incandescence was visible nightly and ashfall was often reported in Toshima village (4 km SSW). The Alert Level remained at 2 and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater.
344040,Telica,9/1/2021,"INETER reported that at 0525 on 1 September an explosion at Telica produced an ash plume that rose 250 m above the crater rim and drifted N and NW. Emissions periodically continued later that day, without explosions, and caused minor ashfall in areas to the NW, W, and SW including in the communities of Aguas Frías, San Pedro Nuevo, and Las Marías (7 km NNW)."
373060,Askja,9/8/2021,"On 9 September IMO raised the Aviation Color Code for Askja to Yellow, noting that inflation that began in early August was ongoing and notably rapid. The uplift was centered at the W edge of Oskjuvatn caldera, which rose a total of 7 cm. The data suggested that magma was accumulating at 2-3.5 km depth."
284130,Fukutoku-Oka-no-Ba,9/8/2021,"The Japan Coast Guard reported that during a 12 September overflight of Fukutoku-Oka-no-Ba, observers noted that the W island was unchanged while the E side had been completely eroded and submerged. Yellow-green to yellow-brown discolored water extended from the vent area to the SW, S, and SE, suggesting continuing eruptive activity. Another area of discolored water had an approximate diameter of 2 km and was about 2 km ENE of the volcano. The discolored water prompted JMA to issue a navigation warning to nearby vessels."
383010,La Palma,9/8/2021,"Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN) and Instituto Volcanológico de Canarias (INVOLCAN) reported that a seismic swarm beneath Cumbre Vieja at the S part of La Palma began at 1618 on 11 September and was likely associated with a magmatic intrusion. The swarm intensified in number of events and magnitude, and by 1600 on 12 September a total of 315 earthquakes had been recorded and ranged 8-13 km in depth. The largest event was a M 2.8 (on the Mb_lg scale). On 13 September a scientific committee comprised of representatives from multiple agencies and institutions raised the Alert Level to Yellow (the second lowest level on a four-color scale) for the municipalities of El Paso, Los Llanos de Aridane, Mazo, and Fuencaliente de la Palma. By 0800 on 14 September 2,935 earthquakes had been detected. Larger events were felt by residents during 13-14 September; the largest earthquake was a M 3.9, recorded at 0600 on 14 September. Overall, the events were becoming shallower (8-10 km) and hypocenters migrated slightly to the W. GPS and tiltmeter networks showed deformation totaling 1.5 cm centered over the clusters of epicenters.

A total of 10 seismic swarms have been detected at La Palma since 2017; one in 2017, one in 2018, five in 2020, and three in 2021. The earthquakes in the previous swarms were deeper, between 20 and 30 km, and were less intense than the current swarm."
284170,Pagan,9/8/2021,"The U.S. Geological Survey reported that emissions of ash and sulfur dioxide from Pagan were last detected on 6 September, though robust steam plumes occasionally continued to be visible at least through 14 September. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level were lowered to Yellow and Advisory, respectively, on 10 September."
241040,Whakaari/White Island,9/8/2021,"On 14 September GeoNet reported that intermittent ash emissions at Whakaari/White Island continued to be visible during the previous week. Vigorous fumarolic plumes from the active vent area sometimes carried minor amounts of ash downwind at low altitudes and occasionally deposited ash on the island. Periods where ash was visible in the emissions did not correspond to explosive seismic or acoustic signals, suggesting that the ash was produced by weak wall fragments falling into the gas stream through the active vents and not from eruptive activity. Seismicity was characterized by low levels of volcanic tremor and occasional volcanic earthquakes. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 2 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Yellow."
282080,Aira,9/8/2021,"JMA reported that incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was visible at night during 6-10 September.

371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,9/8/2021,"The fissure eruption in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, had paused for several days. The Institute of Earth Sciences reported that based on aerial photography acquired on 9 September, during the pause, the area of the flow field had grown to 4.6 square kilometers, and the total volume erupted was 143 million cubic meters. The crater floor was visible and was at least 70 m deep, with a deeper cavity or drainage sometimes visible.

Lava visibly returned on 11 September; RSAM values increased and low lava fountains emerged from a few areas on the flow field to the W of the main crater. Lava also returned to the main vent. Lava fountains from the main crater were visible for periods of 5-10 minutes on 13 September and lava advanced in multiple directions. Lava flowed N on 14 September. By 15 September lava quickly advanced S, flowing past the earthen barriers constructed at the S end of Geldingadalur valley, and turning E into the Nàtthagi valley. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities also warned of gas emission hazards."
252010,Langila,9/8/2021,"Based on analyses of satellite imagery and wind model data, the Darwin VAAC reported that during 11-12 September ash plumes from Langila rose to 2.1-2.4 km (7,000-8,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted W. A thermal anomaly at the summit was identified in satellite data."
264230,Lewotolok,9/8/2021,"PVMBG reported that the eruption at Lewotolok continued during 7-14 September. White-and-gray plumes rose as high as 700 m above the summit and drifted NWW, SW, and S. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a scale of 1-4) and the public was warned to stay 3 km away from the summit crater."
263250,Merapi,9/8/2021,"BPPTKG reported that both of Merapi’s two lava domes, situated just below the SW rim and in the summit crater, continued to grow during 3-9 September. The SW dome grew 5 m taller and had an estimated volume of 1.55 million cubic meters and the summit lava dome grew 1 m wider and had an estimated volume of 2.85 million cubic meters. One pyroclastic flow traveled 2 km down the SW flank and as many as 129 lava avalanches traveled a maximum of 2 km SW.

357070,Nevados de Chillan,9/8/2021,"SERNAGEOMIN reported continuing explosive and effusive activity at Nevados de Chillán’s Nicanor Crater during 16-31 August, though weather conditions often prevented visual confirmation. Explosions generated ash plumes that rose as high as 1.1 km above the crater rim and were denser towards the end of August. Crater incandescence was sometimes visible at night, and though not intense, it brightened during explosive periods. The L5 and L6 lava flows continued to advance, though at a very low rate, averaging 1 m/h for L5. The L5 lava flow was 1,380 m long and L6 was 850 m long based on satellite images, measured from the rim of Nicanor Crater to the distal end of the flows. A decrease in thermal anomalies over the flows identified in satellite images suggested that the flows were cooling. The average temperature was 73 degrees Celsius with a maximum of 100 degrees for L5 and an average of 79 degrees Celsius with a maximum of 100 degrees for L6. Temperatures at the vents at Nicanor Crater averaged 115 degrees Celsius and were as high as 252 degrees during explosive phases. Sulfur dioxide emissions measured from local DOAS stations abruptly decreased and remained low. There was a total of five thermal anomalies, all with low radiance values. On 29 August pyroclastic flows traveled 560 m NE and collapses of L5’s middle and distal parts of the flow were observed. The Alert Level remained at Yellow, the second lowest level on a four-color scale. ONEMI stated that Alert Level Yellow (the middle level on a three-color scale) remained in place for the communities of Pinto and Coihueco, noting that the public should stay at least 2 km away from the crater."
312030,Pavlof,9/8/2021,"AVO reported that seismicity at Pavlof continued at low levels during 7-14 September and was interspersed with periods of more energetic tremor. Although weather clouds often obscured views, a series of four very minor ash emissions were visible in webcam images for a period of five hours on 10 September. The explosions produced minor and diffuse ash emissions that rose from a vent on the E flank and dissipated within minutes. A small explosion was recorded on 12 September and on 13 September, though cloud cover prevented visual confirmation of both events. The Volcano Alert Level and Aviation Color Code remained at Watch and Orange, respectively."
311060,Semisopochnoi,9/8/2021,"AVO reported that eruptive activity at Semisopochnoi's North Cerberus crater continued during 7-14 September.

Sulfur dioxide emissions were detected in satellite images at altitudes less than 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l., sometimes extending downwind for hundreds of kilometers. During 7-9 September periods of lower-altitude ash emissions interspersed with voluminous steam plumes were observed in web camera images moving horizontally by the wind and rising no higher than 1.5 km (5,000 ft) a.s.l. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Watch."
300270,Sheveluch,9/8/2021,KVERT reported that a bright thermal anomaly over Sheveluch was identified in satellite images during 3-10 September. The Kamchatka Branch of Geophysical Services (KBGS; Russian Academy of Sciences) Kamchatka volcano station reported that tourists visiting the volcano on 8 September experienced ashfall; weather conditions prevented views of summit. The next day they saw a small pyroclastic flow and that night saw crater incandescence and small incandescent avalanches traveling SE. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale).
282030,Suwanosejima,9/8/2021,JMA reported that four explosions at Suwanosejima's Ontake Crater produced eruption plumes that rose as high as 3.3 km above the crater rim during 3-10 September. Large volcanic bombs were ejected 500 m from the crater. Crater incandescence was visible nightly. The Alert Level remained at 2 and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater.
273070,Taal,9/8/2021,"PHIVOLCS reported that gas-and-steam plumes from Taal rose as high as 2.5 km above the lake during 8-14 September and drifted NE, SE, S, and SW.

PHIVOLCS reminded the public that the entire Taal Volcano Island is a Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) and that boating on Taal Lake was prohibited."
383010,La Palma,9/15/2021,"An eruption began at La Palma after about a week of intensifying seismicity that showed hypocenters becoming shallower and moving NW, and significant related inflation. During 17-18 September the PEVOLCA (Plan de Emergencias Volcánicas de Canarias) steering committee (comprised of representatives from multiple agencies, local authorities, and institutions) reviewed mitigation, evacuation, and emergency plans. Helicopter and drone overflights were conducted in areas thought to be at risk from an eruption. IGN reported that during 17-18 September seismicity decreased, though an M 2 felt by local residents was located at 100 m depth, and vertical deformation occurred near the earthquake epicenters.

IGN noted that seismicity intensified during the morning of 19 September, with earthquakes located at 0-6 km depth; a M 4.2 event was recorded at 1116 and vertical deformation increased. Authorities evacuated about 50 residents with reduced mobility and their companions from Las Manchas de Abajo, Jedey, San Nicolás and El Paraíso (El Paso and Los Llanos de Aridane), El Charco (Fuencaliente), La Bombilla (Los Llanos de Aridane and Tazacorte), and El Remo and Puerto Naos (Los Llanos de Aridane). Residents in an area prone to landslides were also evacuated. Other preparations continued at the hospital, in neighborhoods, and at evacuation centers.

At 1510 on 19 September an eruption began in the area of Cabeza de Vaca, in the municipality of El Paso. Observers near the eruption site observed a large explosion that ejected material and produced a gas-and-ash plume; volcanic tremor was recorded by the seismic network. Two 200-m-long fissures aligned N-S opened about 200 m apart. INVOLCAN scientists observed seven vents along the fissures during the initial stage of the eruption. Multiple tall lava fountains fed flows downslope to the W, igniting forest fires. Photos and video posted by IGN showed multiple pulsating fountains fanning out from parts of the fissure. Ash plumes rose about 1.5 km and gas plumes rose 3 km and drifted ESE. The PEVOLCA steering committee briefly raised the Alert Level to Orange, and then to Red (the highest level on a four-color scale) by 1700 for high-risk municipalities directly affected by the eruption. About 5,500 people evacuated with no injuries reported, and authorities recommended that residents stay at least 2 km from the vents. The La Palma airport briefly closed, livestock were evacuated, and education centers were closed along with sections of multiple highways. Later that day INVOLCAN scientists who measured an area of the flows determined an average flow rate of 700 m per hour and temperatures around 1,075 degrees Celsius. By the next day a main cone had formed.

The sulfur dioxide gas emission rate was 6,000-11,500 tons per day during 19-20 September. Satellite data showed a plume of sulfur dioxide drifting 475 km SE and reaching the coastline of Africa by 20 September. A map produced on 20 September by IGN in partnership with Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) showed that the main part of the lava flow had traveled more than 3 km W and another branch extended about 1.5 km WSW. The flows had covered about 1 square kilometer and destroyed an estimated 166 buildings. A news article noted that activity was concentrated at four main vents, the last (and ninth) of which opened at 1956 on 20 September about 900 m from the main vents. Strong lava fountaining continued during 20-21 September and ash fell in the vicinity of the vents. Ash plumes rose 2.4-4.6 km (8,000-15,000 ft) a.s.l. and drifted as far as 55 km SW and S according to the Toulouse VAAC. Sulfur dioxide gas plumes drifted W and E at an altitude of 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. By 0814 on 21 September an updated Copernicus EMS map showed that 350 homes had been covered by lava and the flow field had expanded to 1.54 square kilometers. According to a news report lava up to 12 m thick was advancing at a rate of 200 m per hour. A few hundred more residents evacuated as lava advanced towards Tacande; bringing the number of evacuees to about 5,700. The S lava branch was advancing slowly, at a rate of 2 m per hour. Later that day INVOLCAN stated that increased volcanic tremor amplitude reflected greater intensity of Strombolian explosions at the vents."
311060,Semisopochnoi,9/15/2021,"AVO reported that eruptive activity at Semisopochnoi's North Cerberus crater continued during 15-21 September. Weather clouds obscured views of the volcano on most days. Several small daily explosions were recorded by local seismic stations; ash plumes were not visible in satellite images suggesting that they remained below 3 km (10,000 ft) a.s.l. and did not rise above the cloud deck. Overnight during 18-19 September small, discontinuous, low-level ash plumes were visible drifting 100 km SE. Ash emissions increased in frequency and intensity on 19 September. Ash clouds rose as high as 4.6 km (15,000 ft) a.s.l. and continued to drift 100 km SE. Sulfur dioxide emissions increased in the afternoon. AVO raised the Aviation Color Code to Red and the Volcano Alert Level to Warning at 2158. Explosions continued overnight and the next day, and ash plumes rose up to 4.6 km a.s.l. Plumes drifted 100 km NW. At 2012 on 20 September AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code to Orange noting the frequency of discrete explosions had decreased to a rate of about one per hour, though ash plumes from these events were still rising to 4.6 km a.s.l. and drifting NW. Sulfur dioxide plumes drifted N during 20-21 September."
264020,Agung,9/15/2021,PVMBG reported that activity at Agung was last observed on 13 June 2019 and a thermal anomaly over the crater was last identified in satellite images in October 2019.

371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,9/15/2021,"The eruption from the fifth vent in the W part of the Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, continued during 15-18 September. According to a news article lava ponded for a few days in Geldingadalur, and during 14-15 September the crust ruptured and sent a larger lava flow rapidly into the S part of the valley; the flow then turned E into the Nàtthagi valley. Authorities temporarily closed the area due to the activity and the large number of tourists; the Coast Guard rescued two people whose exit route had been cut off by the flow. Lava continued to flow on this path during 16-17 September and overtook the “A” hiking trail. Later that day at around 1800 the flow rate decreased or paused, and only minor incandescence from the vent was visible.

The Institute of Earth Sciences reported that based on aerial photography acquired on 17 September the area of the flow field had grown to 4.8 square kilometers, and the total volume erupted was 151 million cubic meters. The lava-flow rate during 11-17 September averaged 16 cubic meters per second. IMO noted that 19 September marked six months since the eruption started."

The Alert Level remained at 2 and the public was warned to stay 1 km away from the crater."
383010,La Palma,9/22/2021,"The eruption at La Palma continued during 21-28 September, characterized by Strombolian explosions, lava fountaining from multiple vents, advancing lava flows, and sometimes dense, daily ash emissions. A strong increase in tremor amplitude during the afternoon of 21 September was coincident with intensifying Strombolian activity. Explosive activity again increased on 22 September and dense plumes with abundant amounts of ash rose 3-4.6 km (10,000-15,000 ft) a.s.l. and caused ashfall in areas downwind; ash deposits were 3 cm thick in an unspecified area 1 km from the vents. The main lava flow advanced W towards the coast. Ash emissions significantly increased on 23 September with plumes rising as high as 5 km (16,400 ft) a.s.l. A series of powerful explosions began at 1720 and shock waves could be seen propagating through the emission plumes. Vigorous lava fountaining was continuous. Volcanic tremor amplitude was high and variable, peaking at 1500 on 24 September with the highest values since the eruption started. The peak occurred just before two new vents opened on the flank of the main cone, and then notably decreased afterwards, but remained at high levels. Lava from the new vents rapidly traveled more than 1 km downslope, covering older flows, before slowing to 60-80 meters per hour. According to a news report, the explosions ejected tephra outside of the exclusion zone. An evacuation order was issued in the early afternoon for Tajuya, Tacande de Abajo, and part of Tacande de Arriba, affecting 300-400 people. Three airlines suspended flights to La Palma. The lava flow field had expanded to 1.9 square kilometers, destroyed more than 420 buildings, and covered 15.2 km of roads.

Tremor amplitude decreased around noon on 25 September, along with the intensity of the Strombolian explosions. During 25-26 September ash fell in nearby municipalities and as far as the E coast of the island. On 26 September the PEVOLCA steering committee recommended that residents who had evacuated two days earlier could return. The report described two main lava flows, with a highly fluid northern flow and a southern flow that was 2.5 km long. Sulfur dioxide emissions remained significant with an average rate of 25,000 tons per day, and ash plumes rose as high as 3 km above the vents. Lava continued to advance and flowed through Todoque, crossing the LP-213 road, just W of the main part of the town, at around 1900. The flow was 600 m across at the widest part and the leading edge was 4-6 m tall. Lava fountaining and low-intensity Strombolian explosions persisted. Copernicus EMS estimated that the lava covered 2.37 square kilometers, had destroyed 513 houses, and covered 18.9 km of roads. Multiple lava fountains feeding flows were visible on 27 September though the activity waned for a period of about eight hours. By the evening activity had resumed and low-intensity Strombolian explosions were visible.

Beginning at 0245 on 28 September lava fountains fed a new high-temperature, fast-moving flow that descended on top of older flank flows. The leading edge of the main flow continued to advance W and covered banana greenhouses, burning the plastic and igniting a storage of fertilizer resulting in small explosions and a brown odorous plume. About 140 more structures were covered by flows. In preparation for a possible ocean entry, authorities recommended that residents within a 5 km radius of the coastline keep their doors and windows closed, to stay away from windows in case they break, and to cover faces and skin in case of ashfall. Dense ash-and-gas plumes continued to rise from the main vents, as high as 5 km; the rising plume created gravity waves that looked like ripples moving away from the top of the plume. Late in the day lava reached the coastal area, descended a 100-m-high sea cliff, and by 2302 reached the ocean at Playa de los Guirres. Black-and-white plumes rose from where the lava contacted the water."
223030,Nyiragongo,9/22/2021,OVG reported that lava had returned to Nyiragongo’s summit crater based on a 29 September Sentinel satellite image.
282080,Aira,9/22/2021,"JMA reported that incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was visible on most nights during 20-27 September. The trend of inflation first detected on 13 September had begun to slow down by 21 September. The sulfur dioxide emission rate was high at 2,600 tons per day on 22 September. An eruptive event at 0110 on 23 September and two more during 24-27 September produced plumes that rose 1.1 km above the crater rim. The Alert Level remained at 3 (on a 5-level scale), and residents were warned to stay 2 km away from the crater."
290380,Ebeko,9/22/2021,"According to volcanologists in Severo-Kurilsk (Paramushir Island), about 7 km E of Ebeko, explosions on 20 September produced ash plumes that rose as high as 1.7 km (5,600 ft) a.s.l. and drifted SE.

342090,Fuego,9/22/2021,"INSIVUMEH reported that during the night of 21-22 September a possible lava flow had traveled 400 m down Fuego’s Ceniza drainage on the SSW flank. Ash rose along the flow forming a curtain that extended above the summit; ash fell in communities to the W and SW. Explosions at a rate of 6-11 per hour produced ash plumes that rose as high as 800 m above the summit and drifted W and SW.

INSIVUMEH and CONRED reported that activity significantly increased on 23 September. Seismic activity intensified during the early morning and Strombolian activity at the summit was visible. Incandescent material was ejected 100-300 m high. Lava flows traveled 1 km down the Ceniza (SSW) and Trinidad (S) drainages, and sent block-and-ash flows down the Ceniza, Trinidad, Taniluyá, Las Lajas, and Santa Teresa (W) drainages to vegetated areas. Shock waves were detected within a 10 km radius. At 0540 a pyroclastic flow traveled 4-6 km down the Ceniza drainage, reaching the base of the volcano. According to CONRED a pyroclastic flow descended the Ceniza and Trinidad drainages 2-4 km. Explosions generated ash plumes that rose as high as 2.3 km above the summit and drifted 30 km W and SW. The activity began to decline around noon the next day, based on seismicity, acoustic data, and field observations. A few hours later RSAM data suggested that the period of elevated activity had ended after about 32 hours from the onset. Lava flows were no longer active by 25 September.

During 24-28 September there were that 6-12 explosions per hour generating ash plumes as high as 1.1 km above the crater rim and shock waves that often rattled buildings within 10 km of the volcano. Ash plumes mostly drifted as far as 15 km W and SW, causing daily ashfall in several areas downwind, including Morelia (9 km SW), Panimaché I and II (8 km SW), Santa Sofía (12 km SW), Finca Palo Verde, and San Pedro Yepocapa (8 km NW). Block avalanches descended the Ceniza (SSW), Seca (W), Trinidad (S), Taniluyá (SW), Las Lajas (SE), and Honda drainages, often reaching vegetated areas. Explosions ejected incandescent material 100-300 m above the summit on most days."
311120,Great Sitkin,9/22/2021,"AVO reported that lava effusion continued at Great Sitkin during 22-28 September, though weather clouds sometimes prevented webcam and satellite views. Seismicity remained elevated and was characterized by small earthquakes consistent with lava effusion. By 24 September the dome had overtopped the S and W crater rims and flowed 305 m down the S flank and 195 m down the W flank. The dome was about 25 m thick and had grown to 1,170 m E to W and 925 m N to S in dimension. The Aviation Color Code and the Volcano Alert Level remained at Orange and Watch, respectively."

241040,Whakaari/White Island,9/22/2021,"On 27 September GeoNet reported results from an overflight of Whakaari/White Island the previous week. Gas measurements showed that sulfur dioxide emissions had increased to 680 tons per day from 450 tons per day recorded in mid-August, continuing the trend of an increasing emission rate noted over the past few months. The gas data suggested magma input deeper in the system. Temperatures in the main vent area notably decreased to 189 degrees Celsius from July and August measurements of 650 degrees, possibly indicating cooling caused by groundwater infiltration. Minor ash deposits from recent emissions were visible around the active vents. Seismicity was characterized by low levels of volcanic tremor and occasional low-frequency volcanic earthquakes. Subsidence continued to be measured by satellite. The Volcanic Alert Level remained at 2 and the Aviation Color Code remained at Yellow."
332010,Kilauea,9/29/2021,"Seismicity abruptly increased below Kilauea’s summit at about 1400 on 29 September. Around 30 minutes later the earthquakes became more intense, frequent, and shallower, and deformation patterns rapidly changed. The data suggested an upward movement of magma that prompted HVO to raise the Aviation Color Code to Orange and the Volcano Alert Level to Watch at 1509. A new eruption was identified at 1521 when incandescence from Halema`uma`u Crater became visible in webcam views; HVO raised the Aviation Color Code to Red and the Volcano Alert Level to Warning. Fissures opened along the bottom of Halema`uma`u Crater floor and produced lava fountains and flows. A photo taken at 1615 showed a large plume comprised of steam, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide rising from the fissures. Measurements just after the eruption started showed sulfur dioxide emissions of around 85,000 tonnes/day. At about 1640 another fissure with several vents opened on the inner W wall of the crater and produced low lava fountains and flows that descended to the crater floor. The vent expanded by 1709. Lava from both fissures pooled on the solidified lava lake surface and quickly began to overturn and create a lava lake. Tephra was deposited in areas SW of the crater and collected by HVO scientists for analysis.

The tallest lava fountain was near the S end of the lava lake and rose 20-25 m during the night of 29-30 September. During a helicopter overflight around 0730 on 30 September scientists determined that the lake was about 980 m E-W and 710 m N-S, covering an estimated 52 hectares. The W wall vent was visible, and several fountains were rising from the fissure in the central part of the lake. Sulfur dioxide emission rates remained high, estimated at around 20,000 tonnes/day. Overnight during 30 September-1 October fountains rose as high as 15 m at the dominant vent in the W wall. Less vigorous fountaining persisted at other vents, though fewer were active. The lake had risen 24 m by the morning of 1 October, adding 4 m in the past day. Cooled and crusted parts of the lake’s surface overturned, or “foundered.” Sulfur dioxide emission rates remained high, estimated at around 12,900 tonnes per day.

The lake had risen another 2 m by the morning of 2 October; fountains were 7 m tall at the main W wall vent and 1-2 m at the southern vents. Fountains occasionally rose as high as 50-60 m in bursts. Pumice, Pele?s hair, and fragments of volcanic glass were deposited downwind. The sulfur dioxide emission rate on 3 October was again high at 14,750 tonnes/day. The W vent was again the most vigorous during 3-4 October with sustained lava fountains to 10-15 m with occasional bursts up to 20 m. The lake rose 3 m, past the base of the W vent where a 12-m-high spatter cone had formed, and continued to founder in spots. Lava fountains rose 5-10 m from the vents in the S and central portions of the lake, including along a fissure 35-42 m long, with occasional larger bursts. The lake was not level and generally higher near the location of the vents; the W end was 1-2 m higher than the E, and S end was about 1 m higher than the N. By 4 October ledges about 20 m wide separated the N and E parts of the active lava lake from the crater wall and were lower than the lake surface; the N, E, and S margins of the lake were perched about 3 m above the surrounding ledge. The sulfur dioxide emission rate remained elevated but had decreased to 7,000-9,000 tonnes/day. HVO lowered the Aviation Color Code to Orange and the Volcano Alert Level to Watch at 1652. On 5 October lava fountaining from the W vent was unchanged while fountains from the other vents rose 1-5 m. The lake rose 1 more meter."
383010,La Palma,9/29/2021,"The eruption at La Palma continued during 29 September-5 October, characterized by Strombolian explosions, lava fountaining from multiple vents, lava flows, and daily ash emissions. Seismicity continued to be elevated with earthquakes located mainly 10-15 km deep (though some were 25-40 km deep) in the same area where the swarm first began on 11 September; dozens of events were felt by residents.

Within the first eight days of the eruption, 21-27 September, an estimated 50 million cubic meters of material had been erupted. Just before midnight on 28 September the lava reached the ocean, producing a steam-and-gas plume; within 45 minutes the lava created a 50-m-high delta. The sulfur dioxide flux was as high as 16,760 tons per day. On 29 September the PEVOLCA (Plan de Emergencias Volcánicas de Canarias) steering committee restated that the 2.5 km and maritime exclusion zones around the vents and ocean entry, respectively, remained in effect; residents were periodically allowed to collect belongings and care for animals and crops. The lava covered almost 4.8 square kilometers, burying or damaging 744 buildings. There were 185 evacuees in a local hotel. Ash plumes continued to rise from the active vents, and IGN noted a decrease in plume altitude to 3.5 km (11,500 ft) a.s.l. on 29 September and then a rise to 5 km (16,400 ft) a.s.l. the next day.

Lava continued flowing to the sea along the same path. The lava delta had grown three times in size by 30 September to an estimated 0.17 square kilometers; the furthest edge of the delta was 450 m from the coast, it had spread laterally 600-800 m, and was as thick as 24 m. PEVOLCA lifted access restrictions for residents of Tazacorte, San Borondón, Marina Alta, Marina Baja, and La Condesa (nearly 4,000 people); they had previously been warned to stay indoors to minimize coming into contact with potentially toxic gas plumes generated from the ocean entry. Restrictions for other residents living near the margins of the flows were also lifted.

Two vents opened about 600 m NW of the main cone on 1 October and within two days had formed small cones. Lava from the vents traveled W and joined the main flow field downslope. The lava delta had extended 540 m from the coastline. Ash plumes rose to 3-5 km a.s.l. and drifted S on 2 October, and sulfur dioxide emissions were 3,401 tons per day.

By 3 October an estimated 946 houses had been completely demolished and 128 had been partially damaged. The width of the flow field was a maximum of 1,250 m and lava tubes were identified in satellite images. The lava delta had developed four lobes being fed by multiple flows and had an estimated area of 0.32 square kilometers. In the afternoon the frequency and intensity of explosive activity increased and bombs were ejected as far as 800 m. Lava fountains rose hundreds of meters and ash plumes rose as high as 4.5 km (14,800 ft) a.s.l. The sulfur dioxide emission rate reached 16,000 tons per day. During 1900-1945 one of the new cones collapsed, which allowed the inner lava lake to spill out, sending flows downslope carrying blocks from the destroyed portion of the cone. Ash plumes rose as high as 4.5 km a.s.l. and explosions ejected bombs on 5 October according to a news report. Some explosions produced dense black plumes that billowed as they rose above the vent. The Alert Level remained at Red (the highest level on a four-color scale) for affected communities."
223030,Nyiragongo,9/29/2021,According to a news article the scientific director of GVO stated that lava had returned to Nyiragongo's crater on 18 September. Notable thermal anomalies were visible in Sentinel satellite images on 29 September and 4 October.
211050,Vulcano,9/29/2021,"INGV reported that hydrothermal activity at Vulcano increased in July, and notably more in September. Specifically, temperatures of the fumaroles on the crater rim and on the inner flank had increased along with the amounts of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide in the emissions. The highest temperature of 340 degrees Celsius was along the rim. The temperature and salinity of groundwater measured near the base of La Fossa cone were both elevated, and outgassing from ground sites was noted. On 13 September the seismic network detected a significant increase in microseismcity linked to hydrothermal processes. Additionally, very-long-period events were also recorded for the first time in 15 years when instrumentation able to detect the signals was installed. Deformation on the N side of the cone was first identified in mid-August and totaled 1 cm of uplift by mid-September. The report stated that new seismic stations and instruments to measure carbon dioxide emissions had been added to the monitoring network, and a thermal camera pointing at the fumarolic field was planned. The Dipartimento della Protezione Civile raised the Alert Level to Yellow (the second lowest level on a four-color scale) on 1 October."
282080,Aira,9/29/2021,"JMA reported that incandescence from Minamidake Crater (at Aira Caldera’s Sakurajima volcano) was visible at night during 27 September-4 October.

The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale)."
312170,Katmai,9/29/2021,"AVO reported that beginning at 0400 on 2 October strong winds in the vicinity of Katmai and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes blew unconsolidated ash SE towards Kodiak Island at an altitude up to 1.8 km (6,000 ft) a.s.l. The ash was originally deposited during the Novarupta eruption in 1912. The Volcano Alert Level remained at Normal and the Aviation Color Code remained at Green."
300260,Klyuchevskoy,9/29/2021,On 29 September strong winds resuspended unconsolidated ash from Klyuchevskoy’s flanks causing KVERT to raise the Aviation Color Code to Orange (the second highest level on a four-color scale). Conditions were quiet the next day; KVERT lowered the Aviation Color Code back to Green.
371030,Krysuvik-Trolladyngja,9/29/2021,"The Institute of Earth Sciences reported that lava effusion at Krýsuvík-Trölladyngja volcanic system, close to Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, likely ceased during the evening of 18 September. The area of the flow field was about 4.85 square kilometers, and the total volume erupted was 150 million cubic meters, based on 30 September measurements. Parts of lava flows thickened in areas to the S of Geldingadalur and in Nàtthagi valley, and deflated in areas N of Geldingadalur. Points of incandescence were visible at night, at least through 4 October, likely from lava flows that continued to advance downslope.

A seismic swarm in an area SW of Keilir (about 10 km NE of the fifth vent), at the N end of the dike intrusion, began on 27 September. According to news reports, over 6,000 earthquakes at depths of 5-6 km had been recorded by 4 October with at least 12 of them over M 3; the largest event was a M 3.8. Some of the larger events were felt in the capital. The seismicity was similar to patterns recorded before the beginning of the eruption to the SW. IMO stated that more data was needed to characterize the data as either indicative of magma movement or due to tectonic stress. The Aviation Color Code remained at Orange due to the lack of ash and tephra emissions, though IMO warned of the potential for lapilli and scoria fallout within a 650 m radius of the active vent. Authorities also warned of gas emission hazards."
